{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-41055", "Description": "LibreY is a fork of LibreX, a framework-less and javascript-free privacy respecting meta search engine. LibreY is subject to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the `engines/google/text.php` and `engines/duckduckgo/text.php` files in versions before commit be59098abd119cda70b15bf3faac596dfd39a744. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to request the server to send HTTP GET requests to arbitrary targets and conduct Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks via the `wikipedia_language` cookie. Remote attackers can request the server to download large files to reduce the performance of the server or even deny access from legitimate users. This issue has been patched in https://github.com/Ahwxorg/LibreY/pull/9. LibreY hosters are advised to use the latest commit. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-41055", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF);Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nAhwx\u00bbLibreyVersions  before (<) 2023-08-17cpe:2.3:a:ahwx:librey:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-06  0.16%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-09-10  0.10%  0.16%  +0.06 \n 3  2024-08-04  0.08%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-09-09  0.05%  0.08%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Ahwxorg/LibreY/security/advisories/GHSA-xfj6-4vp9-8rgc", "ref_desc": "LibreY Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability via wikipedia_language cookie \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Ahwxorg/LibreY \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Ahwxorg/LibreY/pull/9", "ref_desc": "stuff by codedipper \u00b7 Pull Request #9 \u00b7 Ahwxorg/LibreY \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
