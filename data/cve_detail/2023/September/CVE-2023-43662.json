{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-43662", "Description": "ShokoServer is a media server which specializes in organizing anime. In affected versions the `/api/Image/WithPath` endpoint is accessible without authentication and is supposed to return default server images. The endpoint accepts the parameter `serverImagePath`, which is not sanitized in any way before being passed to `System.IO.File.OpenRead`, which results in an arbitrary file read. This issue may lead to an arbitrary file read which is exacerbated in the windows installer which installs the ShokoServer as administrator. Any unauthenticated attacker may be able to access sensitive information and read files stored on the server. The `/api/Image/WithPath` endpoint has been removed in commit `6c57ba0f0` which will be included in subsequent releases. Users should limit access to the `/api/Image/WithPath` endpoint or manually patch their installations until a patched release is made. This issue was discovered by the GitHub Security lab and is also indexed as GHSL-2023-191.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-43662", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nShokoanime\u00bbShokoserverVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.2.2cpe:2.3:a:shokoanime:shokoserver:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "2.26% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 90 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-30  3.18%  2.26%  -0.91 \n 2  2024-10-04  3.59%  3.18%  -0.41 \n 3  2024-08-28  3.25%  3.59%  +0.33 \n 4  2024-07-19  0.09%  3.25%  +3.16 \n 5  2024-06-18  0.13%  0.09%  -0.04 \n 6  2024-04-12  0.18%  0.13%  -0.05 \n 7  2023-10-07  0.05%  0.18%  +0.13 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ShokoAnime/ShokoServer/security/advisories/GHSA-mwcv-ghjq-8f2g", "ref_desc": "GHSL-2023-191: Arbitrary File Read \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ShokoAnime/ShokoServer \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Mitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ShokoAnime/ShokoServer/commit/6c57ba0f073d6be5a4f508c46c2ce36727cbce80", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-mwcv-ghjq-8f2g \u00b7 ShokoAnime/ShokoServer@6c57ba0 \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
