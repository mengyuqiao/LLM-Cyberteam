{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-37459", "Description": "Contiki-NG is an operating system for internet-of-things devices. In versions 4.9 and prior, when a packet is received, the Contiki-NG network stack attempts to start the periodic TCP timer if it is a TCP packet with the SYN flag set. But the implementation does not first verify that a full TCP header has been received. Specifically, the implementation attempts to access the flags field from the TCP buffer in the following conditional expression in the `check_for_tcp_syn` function. For this reason, an attacker can inject a truncated TCP packet, which will lead to an out-of-bound read from the packet buffer. As of time of publication, a patched version is not available. As a workaround, one can apply the changes in Contiki-NG pull request #2510 to patch the system.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-37459", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nContiki-ng\u00bbContiki-ngVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.9cpe:2.3:o:contiki-ng:contiki-ng:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 31 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-17  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-09-21  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-08-15  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-09-20  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/2510", "ref_desc": "tcpip: Check whether we have a full TCP header before checking if the SYN flag is set. by nvt \u00b7 Pull Request #2510 \u00b7 contiki-ng/contiki-ng \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/security/advisories/GHSA-6648-m23r-hq8c", "ref_desc": "Out-of-bounds read when processing a received IPv6 packet \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 contiki-ng/contiki-ng \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
