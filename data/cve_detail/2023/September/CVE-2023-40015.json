{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-40015", "Description": "Vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language. For the following (probably non-exhaustive) list of expressions, the compiler evaluates the arguments from right to left instead of left to right. `unsafe_add, unsafe_sub, unsafe_mul, unsafe_div, pow_mod256, |, &, ^ (bitwise operators), bitwise_or (deprecated), bitwise_and (deprecated), bitwise_xor (deprecated), raw_call, <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=, in, not in (when lhs and rhs are enums)`. This behaviour becomes a problem when the evaluation of one of the arguments produces side effects that other arguments depend on. The following expressions can produce side-effect: state modifying external call , state modifying internal call, `raw_call`, `pop()` when used on a Dynamic Array stored in the storage, `create_minimal_proxy_to`, `create_copy_of`, `create_from_blueprint`. This issue has not yet been patched. Users are advised to make sure that the arguments of the expression do not produce side effects or, if one does, that no other argument is dependent on those side effects.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-40015", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nVyperlang\u00bbVyper\u00bbForPythonVersions  up to, including, (<=) 0.3.9cpe:2.3:a:vyperlang:vyper:*:*:*:*:*:python:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 30 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-10  0.05%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-08-04  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-09-09  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-670 Always-Incorrect Control Flow Implementation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/670/Always-Incorrect-Control-Flow-Implementation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/security/advisories/GHSA-g2xh-c426-v8mf", "ref_desc": "reversed order of side effects for some operations \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 vyperlang/vyper \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
