{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-41330", "Description": "knplabs/knp-snappy is a PHP library allowing thumbnail, snapshot or PDF generation from a url or a html page.\n## Issue\n\nOn March 17th the vulnerability CVE-2023-28115 was disclosed, allowing an attacker to gain remote code execution through PHAR deserialization. Version 1.4.2 added a check `if (\\strpos($filename, 'phar://') === 0)` in the `prepareOutput` function to resolve this CVE, however if the user is able to control the second parameter of the `generateFromHtml()` function of Snappy, it will then be passed as the `$filename` parameter in the `prepareOutput()` function. In the original vulnerability, a file name with a `phar://` wrapper could be sent to the `fileExists()` function, equivalent to the `file_exists()` PHP function. This allowed users to trigger a deserialization on arbitrary PHAR files. To fix this issue, the string is now passed to the `strpos()` function and if it starts with `phar://`, an exception is raised. However, PHP wrappers being case insensitive, this patch can be bypassed using `PHAR://` instead of `phar://`. A successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows executing arbitrary code and accessing the underlying filesystem. The attacker must be able to upload a file and the server must be running a PHP version prior to 8. This issue has been addressed in commit `d3b742d61a` which has been included in version 1.4.3. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that only trusted users may submit data to the `AbstractGenerator->generate(...)` function.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-41330", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nKnplabs\u00bbSnappyVersions  before (<) 1.4.3cpe:2.3:a:knplabs:snappy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.76% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 88 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-08  1.48%  1.76%  +0.28 \n 2  2024-09-12  0.99%  1.48%  +0.49 \n 3  2024-08-06  0.89%  0.99%  +0.10 \n 4  2024-07-13  1.05%  0.89%  -0.16 \n 5  2024-06-09  0.74%  1.05%  +0.31 \n 6  2024-05-05  0.71%  0.74%  +0.03 \n 7  2024-04-24  0.63%  0.71%  +0.08 \n 8  2024-04-01  0.55%  0.63%  +0.08 \n 9  2024-02-27  0.54%  0.55%  +0.01 \n 10  2024-02-17  0.52%  0.54%  +0.03 \n 11  2024-02-09  0.67%  0.52%  -0.15 \n 12  2024-01-24  0.52%  0.67%  +0.15 \n 13  2023-09-13  0.10%  0.52%  +0.42 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/KnpLabs/snappy/commit/d3b742d61a68bf93866032c2c0a7f1486128b67e", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #488 from KnpLabs/fix/security-advisory-GHSA-92rv-\u2026 \u00b7 KnpLabs/snappy@d3b742d \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/KnpLabs/snappy/security/advisories/GHSA-92rv-4j2h-8mjj", "ref_desc": "PHAR deserialization (CVE-2023-28115 patch bypass) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 KnpLabs/snappy \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Mitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/KnpLabs/snappy/security/advisories/GHSA-gq6w-q6wh-jggc", "ref_desc": "PHAR deserialization allowing remote code execution \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 KnpLabs/snappy \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/IWeawGoGzUPE3eGOuz-N5rDdLv0.html"}]}
