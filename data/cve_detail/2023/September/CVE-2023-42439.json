{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-42439", "Description": "GeoNode is an open source platform that facilitates the creation, sharing, and collaborative use of geospatial data. A SSRF vulnerability exists starting in version 3.2.0, bypassing existing controls on the software. This can allow a user to request internal services for a full read SSRF, returning any data from the internal network. The application is using a whitelist, but the whitelist can be bypassed. The bypass will trick the application that the first host is a whitelisted address, but the browser will use `@` or `%40` as a credential to the host geoserver on port 8080, this will return the data to that host on the response. Version 4.1.3.post1 is the first available version that contains a patch.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-42439", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nGeosolutionsgroup\u00bbGeonodeVersions  from including (>=) 3.2.0andbefore (<) 4.1.3cpe:2.3:a:geosolutionsgroup:geonode:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-21  0.07%  0.11%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-08-15  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-09-22  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-09-21  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode/commit/79ac6e70419c2e0261548bed91c159b54ff35b8d", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-pxg5-h34r-7q8p \u00b7 GeoNode/geonode@79ac6e7 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode/security/advisories/GHSA-pxg5-h34r-7q8p", "ref_desc": "SSRF Bypass to return internal host data \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 GeoNode/geonode \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode/releases/tag/4.1.3", "ref_desc": "Release 4.1.3 \u00b7 GeoNode/geonode \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
