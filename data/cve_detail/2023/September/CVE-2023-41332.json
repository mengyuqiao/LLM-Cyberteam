{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-41332", "Description": "Cilium is a networking, observability, and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane. In Cilium clusters where Cilium's Layer 7 proxy has been disabled, creating workloads with `policy.cilium.io/proxy-visibility` annotations (in Cilium >= v1.13) or `io.cilium.proxy-visibility` annotations (in Cilium <= v1.12) causes the Cilium agent to segfault on the node to which the workload is assigned. Existing traffic on the affected node will continue to flow, but the Cilium agent on the node will not able to process changes to workloads running on the node. This will also prevent workloads from being able to start on the affected node. The denial of service will be limited to the node on which the workload is scheduled, however an attacker may be able to schedule workloads on the node of their choosing, which could lead to targeted attacks. This issue has been resolved in Cilium versions 1.14.2, 1.13.7, and 1.12.14. Users unable to upgrade can avoid this denial of service attack by enabling the Layer 7 proxy.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-41332", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCilium\u00bbCiliumVersions  before (<) 1.12.14cpe:2.3:a:cilium:cilium:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCilium\u00bbCiliumVersions  from including (>=) 1.14.0andbefore (<) 1.14.2cpe:2.3:a:cilium:cilium:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCilium\u00bbCiliumVersions  from including (>=) 1.13.0andbefore (<) 1.13.7cpe:2.3:a:cilium:cilium:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 7 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-755 Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/755/Improper-Handling-of-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/27597", "ref_desc": "proxy: Ignore visibility annotation if proxy is disabled by sayboras \u00b7 Pull Request #27597 \u00b7 cilium/cilium \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/security/advisories/GHSA-24m5-r6hv-ccgp", "ref_desc": "DoS via Kubernetes annotations in specific Cilium configurations \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 cilium/cilium \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Mitigation;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
