{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-39967", "Description": "WireMock is a tool for mocking HTTP services. When certain request URLs like \u201c@127.0.0.1:1234\" are used in WireMock Studio configuration fields, the request might be forwarded to an arbitrary service reachable from WireMock\u2019s instance. There are 3 identified potential attack vectors: via \u201cTestRequester\u201d functionality, webhooks and the proxy mode. As we can control HTTP Method, HTTP Headers, HTTP Data, it allows sending requests with the default level of credentials for the WireMock instance. The vendor has discontinued the affected Wiremock studio product and there will be no fix. Users are advised to find alternatives.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39967", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nWiremock\u00bbStudioVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.32.0-17cpe:2.3:a:wiremock:studio:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.23% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 61 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-08  0.19%  0.23%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-09-12  0.12%  0.19%  +0.07 \n 3  2024-08-06  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-09-14  0.04%  0.11%  +0.06 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/wiremock/wiremock/security/advisories/GHSA-676j-xrv3-73vc", "ref_desc": "Controlled and full-read SSRF through URL parameter when testing a request, webhooks and proxy mode in WireMock Studio \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 wiremock/wiremock \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
