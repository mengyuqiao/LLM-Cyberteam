{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-41331", "Description": "SOFARPC is a Java RPC framework. Versions prior to 5.11.0 are vulnerable to remote command execution. Through a carefully\ncrafted payload, an attacker can achieve JNDI injection or system command execution. In the default configuration of the SOFARPC framework, a blacklist is used to filter out dangerous classes encountered during the deserialization process. However, the blacklist is not comprehensive, and an actor can exploit certain native JDK classes and common third-party packages to construct gadget chains capable of achieving JNDI injection or system command execution attacks. Version 5.11.0 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround, users can add `-Drpc_serialize_blacklist_override=javax.sound.sampled.AudioFileFormat` to the blacklist.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-41331", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSofastack\u00bbSofarpcVersions  before (<) 5.11.0cpe:2.3:a:sofastack:sofarpc:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.37% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 73 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-14  0.36%  0.37%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-09-18  0.22%  0.36%  +0.15 \n 3  2024-08-12  0.19%  0.22%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-06-15  0.13%  0.19%  +0.06 \n 5  2023-10-15  0.10%  0.13%  +0.03 \n 6  2023-09-16  0.05%  0.10%  +0.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-917 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/917/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-Expre.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/sofastack/sofa-rpc/releases/tag/v5.11.0", "ref_desc": "Release v5.11.0 Released \u00b7 sofastack/sofa-rpc \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sofastack/sofa-rpc/security/advisories/GHSA-chv2-7hxj-2j86", "ref_desc": "Remote Command Execution(RCE) Vulnerbility \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 sofastack/sofa-rpc \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
