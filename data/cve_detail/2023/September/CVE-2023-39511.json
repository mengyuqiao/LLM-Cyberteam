{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-39511", "Description": "Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault management framework. Affected versions are subject to a Stored Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability which allows an authenticated user to poison data stored in the _cacti_'s database. These data will be viewed by administrative _cacti_ accounts and execute JavaScript code in the victim's browser at view-time. The script under `reports_admin.php` displays reporting information about graphs, devices, data sources etc. _CENSUS_ found that an adversary that is able to configure a malicious device name, related to a graph attached to a report, can deploy a stored XSS attack against any super user who has privileges of viewing the `reports_admin.php` page, such as administrative accounts. A user that possesses the _General Administration>Sites/Devices/Data_ permissions can configure the device names in _cacti_. This configuration occurs through `http://<HOST>/cacti/host.php`, while the rendered malicious payload is exhibited at `http://<HOST>/cacti/reports_admin.php` when the a graph with the maliciously altered device name is linked to the report. This issue has been addressed in version 1.2.25. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should manually filter HTML output.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39511", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:37cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:37:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:38cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:38:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCacti\u00bbCactiVersions  before (<) 1.2.25cpe:2.3:a:cacti:cacti:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 32 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-12  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-08-06  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-11-05  0.10%  0.06%  -0.04 \n 4  2023-10-21  0.05%  0.10%  +0.05 \n 5  2023-10-13  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-09-12  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-5hpr-4hhc-8q42", "ref_desc": "Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability with Device Name when editing Graphs whilst managing Reports \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Cacti/cacti \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WZGB2UXJEUYWWA6IWVFQ3ZTP22FIHMGN/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 37 Update: cacti-1.2.25-1.fc37 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing ListCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/6aIxv82e5IY6_r-lb23U1ODhhQc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CFH3J2WVBKY4ZJNMARVOWJQK6PSLPHFH/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 38 Update: cacti-spine-1.2.25-1.fc38 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing ListCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/zFZvmZkNPojOfQaIACeRopThois.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WOQFYGLZBAWT4AWNMO7DU73QXWPXTCKH/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 39 Update: cacti-spine-1.2.25-1.fc39 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ZqKQgYJqIOOz-6L1kKhMZx982Ms.html"}]}
