{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-38346", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Wind River VxWorks 6.9 and 7. The function ``tarExtract`` implements TAR file extraction and thereby also processes files within an archive that have relative or absolute file paths. A developer using the \"tarExtract\" function may expect that the function will strip leading slashes from absolute paths or stop processing when encountering relative paths that are outside of the extraction path, unless otherwise forced. This could lead to unexpected and undocumented behavior, which in general could result in a directory traversal, and associated unexpected behavior.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-38346", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nWindriver\u00bbVxworks\u00bbVersion:6.9cpe:2.3:o:windriver:vxworks:6.9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nWindriver\u00bbVxworks\u00bbVersion:7.0cpe:2.3:o:windriver:vxworks:7.0:-:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-28  0.07%  0.12%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-08-22  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-07-29  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-09-27  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://support2.windriver.com/index.php?page=cve&on=view&id=CVE-2023-38346", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-38346Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://support2.windriver.com/index.php?page=security-notices", "ref_desc": "Security Notice - Wind River Support NetworkVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/wjuA-son6XCURxDyw3_y1wygV60.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.pentagrid.ch/en/blog/wind-river-vxworks-tarextract-directory-traversal-vulnerability/", "ref_desc": "Wind River VxWorks tarExtract directory traversal vulnerability (CVE-2023-38346) | Pentagrid AGExploit;Technical Description;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
