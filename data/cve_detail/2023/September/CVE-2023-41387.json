{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-41387", "Description": "A SQL injection in the flutter_downloader component through 1.11.1 for iOS allows remote attackers to steal session tokens and overwrite arbitrary files inside the app's container. The internal database of the framework is exposed to the local user if an app uses UIFileSharingEnabled and LSSupportsOpeningDocumentsInPlace properties. As a result, local users can obtain the same attack primitives as remote attackers by tampering with the internal database of the framework on the device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-41387", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nPatreon\u00bbFlutter DownloaderVersions  before (<) 1.11.2cpe:2.3:a:patreon:flutter_downloader:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Apple\u00bbIphone Os\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-21  0.09%  0.12%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-09-25  0.06%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-08-19  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-09-23  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_downloader/changelog", "ref_desc": "flutter_downloader | Flutter PackageRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://seredynski.com/articles/exploiting-ios-apps-to-extract-session-tokens-and-overwrite-user-data", "ref_desc": "Exploiting iOS apps to extract session tokens and overwrite user dataExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
