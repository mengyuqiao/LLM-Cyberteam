{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-42442", "Description": "JumpServer is an open source bastion host and a professional operation and maintenance security audit system. Starting in version 3.0.0 and prior to versions 3.5.5 and 3.6.4, session replays can download without authentication. Session replays stored in S3, OSS, or other cloud storage are not affected. The api `/api/v1/terminal/sessions/` permission control is broken and can be accessed anonymously. SessionViewSet permission classes set to `[RBACPermission | IsSessionAssignee]`, relation is or, so any permission matched will be allowed. Versions 3.5.5 and 3.6.4 have a fix. After upgrading, visit the api `$HOST/api/v1/terminal/sessions/?limit=1`. The expected http response code is 401 (`not_authenticated`).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-42442", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nFit2cloud\u00bbJumpserverVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andbefore (<) 3.5.5cpe:2.3:a:fit2cloud:jumpserver:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFit2cloud\u00bbJumpserverVersions  from including (>=) 3.6.0andbefore (<) 3.6.4cpe:2.3:a:fit2cloud:jumpserver:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "53.48% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 98 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-24  47.23%  53.48%  +6.25 \n 2  2024-10-17  45.25%  47.23%  +1.98 \n 3  2024-10-04  44.63%  45.25%  +0.62 \n 4  2024-09-21  32.36%  44.63%  +12.27 \n 5  2024-08-15  33.68%  32.36%  -1.32 \n 6  2024-08-11  67.13%  33.68%  -33.45 \n 7  2024-08-04  62.07%  67.13%  +5.06 \n 8  2024-07-22  68.06%  62.07%  -6.00 \n 9  2024-07-11  80.20%  68.06%  -12.14 \n 10  2024-06-29  83.06%  80.20%  -2.86 \n 11  2024-06-18  80.22%  83.06%  +2.84 \n 12  2024-06-05  79.20%  80.22%  +1.02 \n 13  2024-05-14  79.37%  79.20%  -0.17 \n 14  2024-04-10  74.41%  79.37%  +4.96 \n 15  2024-03-22  24.00%  74.41%  +50.41 \n 16  2024-02-18  7.68%  24.00%  +16.32 \n 17  2024-02-02  9.14%  7.68%  -1.47 \n 18  2023-12-31  9.01%  9.14%  +0.14 \n 19  2023-09-27  2.22%  9.01%  +6.79 \n 20  2023-09-22  0.05%  2.22%  +2.17 \n 21  2023-09-21  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/jumpserver/jumpserver/security/advisories/GHSA-633x-3f4f-v9rw", "ref_desc": "Session replays download without authentication \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 jumpserver/jumpserver \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jumpserver/jumpserver/blob/v3.6.1/apps/terminal/api/session/session.py#L91", "ref_desc": "jumpserver/apps/terminal/api/session/session.py at v3.6.1 \u00b7 jumpserver/jumpserver \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jumpserver/jumpserver/commit/0a58bba59cd275bab8e0ae58bf4b359fbc5eb74a", "ref_desc": "fix: \u4fee\u590d private storage permission \u00b7 jumpserver/jumpserver@0a58bba \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
