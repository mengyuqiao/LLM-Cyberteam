{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-41058", "Description": "Parse Server is an open source backend server. In affected versions the Parse Cloud trigger `beforeFind` is not invoked in certain conditions of `Parse.Query`. This can pose a vulnerability for deployments where the `beforeFind` trigger is used as a security layer to modify the incoming query. The vulnerability has been fixed by refactoring the internal query pipeline for a more concise code structure and implementing a patch to ensure the `beforeFind` trigger is invoked. This fix was introduced in commit `be4c7e23c6` and has been included in releases 6.2.2 and 5.5.5. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should make use of parse server's security layers to manage access levels with Class-Level Permissions and Object-Level Access Control that should be used instead of custom security layers in Cloud Code triggers.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-41058", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nParseplatform\u00bbParse-server\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  from including (>=) 6.0.0andbefore (<) 6.2.2cpe:2.3:a:parseplatform:parse-server:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nParseplatform\u00bbParse-server\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 5.5.5cpe:2.3:a:parseplatform:parse-server:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-06  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-09-10  0.08%  0.11%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-08-04  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-09-09  0.05%  0.07%  +0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-670 Always-Incorrect Control Flow Implementation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/670/Always-Incorrect-Control-Flow-Implementation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/releases/tag/5.5.5", "ref_desc": "Release 5.5.5 \u00b7 parse-community/parse-server \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/commit/be4c7e23c63a2fb690685665cebed0de26be05c5", "ref_desc": "fix: Parse Pointer allows to access internal Parse Server classes and\u2026 \u00b7 parse-community/parse-server@be4c7e2 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.parseplatform.org/parse-server/guide/#security", "ref_desc": "Parse Server Guide | ParseProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/security/advisories/GHSA-fcv6-fg5r-jm9q", "ref_desc": "Parse Pointer allows to access internal Parse Server classes and circumvent `beforeFind` query trigger \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 parse-community/parse-server \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/releases/tag/6.2.2", "ref_desc": "Release 6.2.2 \u00b7 parse-community/parse-server \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
