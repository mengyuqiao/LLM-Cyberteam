{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-43637", "Description": "Due to the implementation of \"deriveVaultKey\", prior to version 7.10, the generated vault key\nwould always have the last 16 bytes predetermined to be \"arfoobarfoobarfo\".\n\nThis issue happens because \"deriveVaultKey\" calls \"retrieveCloudKey\" (which will always\nreturn \"foobarfoobarfoobarfoobarfoobarfo\" as the key), and then merges the 32byte\nrandomly generated key with this key (by takeing 16bytes from each, see \"mergeKeys\").\n\nThis makes the key a lot weaker.\n\nThis issue does not persist in devices that were initialized on/after version 7.10, but devices\nthat were initialized before that and updated to a newer version still have this issue.\n\n\n\nRoll an update that enforces the full 32bytes key usage.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-43637", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLfedge\u00bbEVEVersions  before (<) 7.10cpe:2.3:o:lfedge:eve:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 7 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-321 Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/321/Use-of-Hard-coded-Cryptographic-Key.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/798/Use-of-Hard-coded-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://asrg.io/security-advisories/cve-2023-43637/", "ref_desc": "Vault Key Partially Predetermined - Automotive Security Research GroupThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://asrg.io/security-advisories/vault-key-partially-predetermined/", "ref_desc": "Vault Key Partially Predetermined - Automotive Security Research GroupThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
