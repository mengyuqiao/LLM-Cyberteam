{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-44121", "Description": "The vulnerability is an intent redirection in LG ThinQ Service (\"com.lge.lms2\") in the \"com/lge/lms/things/ui/notification/NotificationManager.java\" file. This vulnerability could be exploited by a third-party app installed on an LG device by sending a broadcast with the action \"com.lge.lms.things.notification.ACTION\". Additionally, this vulnerability is very dangerous because LG ThinQ Service is a system app (having android:sharedUserId=\"android.uid.system\" setting). Intent redirection in this app leads to accessing arbitrary not exported activities of absolutely all apps.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-44121", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbAndroidVersions  from including (>=) 9.0andup to, including, (<=) 13.0cpe:2.3:o:google:android:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:LG\u00bbV60 Thin Q 5g\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 11 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-10-03  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-926 Improper Export of Android Application Components", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/926/Improper-Export-of-Android-Application-Components.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lgsecurity.lge.com/bulletins/mobile#updateDetails", "ref_desc": "LG Product SecurityVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/eX6AFEmVpSD0q7ViFSePae6g0Zc.html"}]}
