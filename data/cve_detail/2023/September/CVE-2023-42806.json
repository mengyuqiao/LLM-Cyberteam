{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-42806", "Description": "Hydra is the layer-two scalability solution for Cardano. Prior to version 0.13.0, not signing and verifying `$\\mathsf{cid}$` allows an attacker (which must be a participant of this head) to use a snapshot from an old head instance with the same participants to close the head or contest the state with it. This can lead to an incorrect distribution of value (= value extraction attack; hard, but possible) or prevent the head to finalize because the value available is not consistent with the closed utxo state (= denial of service; easy). A patch is planned for version 0.13.0. As a workaround, rotate keys between heads so not to re-use keys and not result in the same multi-signature participants.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-42806", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nIohk\u00bbHydraVersions  before (<) 0.13.0cpe:2.3:a:iohk:hydra:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 56 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-27  0.12%  0.18%  +0.07 \n 2  2024-08-21  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-09-27  0.05%  0.10%  +0.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/blob/ec6c7a2ab651462228475d0b34264e9a182c22bb/hydra-node/src/Hydra/HeadLogic.hs#L357", "ref_desc": "hydra/hydra-node/src/Hydra/HeadLogic.hs at ec6c7a2ab651462228475d0b34264e9a182c22bb \u00b7 input-output-hk/hydra \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/security/advisories/GHSA-gr36-mc6v-72qq", "ref_desc": "Snapshot signature not including HeadID will allow replay attacks \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 input-output-hk/hydra \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/blob/ec6c7a2ab651462228475d0b34264e9a182c22bb/hydra-node/src/Hydra/Snapshot.hs#L50-L54", "ref_desc": "hydra/hydra-node/src/Hydra/Snapshot.hs at ec6c7a2ab651462228475d0b34264e9a182c22bb \u00b7 input-output-hk/hydra \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/blob/ec6c7a2ab651462228475d0b34264e9a182c22bb/hydra-plutus/src/Hydra/Contract/Head.hs#L583-L599", "ref_desc": "hydra/hydra-plutus/src/Hydra/Contract/Head.hs at ec6c7a2ab651462228475d0b34264e9a182c22bb \u00b7 input-output-hk/hydra \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
