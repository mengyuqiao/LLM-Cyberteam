{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-42443", "Description": "Vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). In version 0.3.9 and prior, under certain conditions, the memory used by the builtins `raw_call`, `create_from_blueprint` and `create_copy_of` can be corrupted. For `raw_call`, the argument buffer of the call can be corrupted, leading to incorrect `calldata` in the sub-context. For `create_from_blueprint` and `create_copy_of`, the buffer for the to-be-deployed bytecode can be corrupted, leading to deploying incorrect bytecode.\n\nEach builtin has conditions that must be fulfilled for the corruption to happen. For `raw_call`, the `data` argument of the builtin must be `msg.data` and the `value` or `gas` passed to the builtin must be some complex expression that results in writing to the memory. For `create_copy_of`, the `value` or `salt` passed to the builtin must be some complex expression that results in writing to the memory. For `create_from_blueprint`, either no constructor parameters should be passed to the builtin or `raw_args` should be set to True, and the `value` or `salt` passed to the builtin must be some complex expression that results in writing to the memory.\n\nAs of time of publication, no patched version exists. The issue is still being investigated, and there might be other cases where the corruption might happen. When the builtin is being called from an `internal` function `F`, the issue is not present provided that the function calling `F` wrote to memory before calling `F`. As a workaround, the complex expressions that are being passed as kwargs to the builtin should be cached in memory prior to the call to the builtin.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-42443", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nVyperlang\u00bbVyper\u00bbForPythonVersions  before (<) 0.3.10cpe:2.3:a:vyperlang:vyper:*:*:*:*:*:python:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-20  0.13%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-09-24  0.10%  0.13%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-08-18  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-09-23  0.04%  0.09%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/issues/3609", "ref_desc": "tracking issue for GHSA-c647-pxm2-c52w (memory initialization in builtins using msize) \u00b7 Issue #3609 \u00b7 vyperlang/vyper \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/security/advisories/GHSA-c647-pxm2-c52w", "ref_desc": "memory corruption in certain builtins utilizing `msize` \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 vyperlang/vyper \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
