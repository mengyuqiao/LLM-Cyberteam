{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-42444", "Description": "phonenumber is a library for parsing, formatting and validating international phone numbers. Prior to versions `0.3.3+8.13.9` and `0.2.5+8.11.3`, the phonenumber parsing code may panic due to a panic-guarded out-of-bounds access on the phonenumber string. In a typical deployment of `rust-phonenumber`, this may get triggered by feeding a maliciously crafted phonenumber over the network, specifically the string `.;phone-context=`. Versions `0.3.3+8.13.9` and `0.2.5+8.11.3` contain a patch for this issue. There are no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-42444", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nWhisperfish\u00bbPhonenumber\u00bbForRustVersions  from including (>=) 0.3.0\\+8.12.9andbefore (<) 0.3.3\\+8.13.9cpe:2.3:a:whisperfish:phonenumber:*:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions\nWhisperfish\u00bbPhonenumber\u00bbForRustVersions  before (<) 0.2.5\\+8.11.3cpe:2.3:a:whisperfish:phonenumber:*:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-21  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-09-25  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-08-19  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-09-23  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-248 Uncaught Exception", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/248/Uncaught-Exception.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-392 Missing Report of Error Condition", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/392/Missing-Report-of-Error-Condition.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1284 Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1284/Improper-Validation-of-Specified-Quantity-in-Input.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/whisperfish/rust-phonenumber/security/advisories/GHSA-whhr-7f2w-qqj2", "ref_desc": "panic on parsing crafted RF3966 phonenumber inputs \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 whisperfish/rust-phonenumber \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/whisperfish/rust-phonenumber/commit/2dd44be94539c051b4dee55d1d9d349bd7bedde6", "ref_desc": "Fix panic on parsing crafted RF3966 phonenumber inputs \u00b7 whisperfish/rust-phonenumber@2dd44be \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/whisperfish/rust-phonenumber/commit/bea8e732b9cada617ede5cf51663dba183747f71", "ref_desc": "Merge branch 'advisory-fix-1' \u00b7 whisperfish/rust-phonenumber@bea8e73 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
