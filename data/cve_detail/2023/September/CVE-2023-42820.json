{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-42820", "Description": "JumpServer is an open source bastion host. This vulnerability is due to exposing the random number seed to the API, potentially allowing the randomly generated verification codes to be replayed, which could lead to password resets. If MFA is enabled users are not affect. Users not using local authentication are also not affected. Users are advised to upgrade to either version 2.28.19 or to 3.6.5. There are no known workarounds or this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-42820", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nFit2cloud\u00bbJumpserverVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andbefore (<) 3.6.5cpe:2.3:a:fit2cloud:jumpserver:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFit2cloud\u00bbJumpserverVersions  from including (>=) 2.24.0andbefore (<) 2.28.19cpe:2.3:a:fit2cloud:jumpserver:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 31 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-28  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-02  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-08-26  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-10-01  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/jumpserver/jumpserver/security/advisories/GHSA-7prv-g565-82qp", "ref_desc": "Random seed leakage results in the user password being reset. \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 jumpserver/jumpserver \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jumpserver/jumpserver/commit/42337f0d00b2a8d45ef063eb5b7deeef81597da5", "ref_desc": "perf: \u4fee\u590d\u968f\u673a error \u00b7 jumpserver/jumpserver@42337f0 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
