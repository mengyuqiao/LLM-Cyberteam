{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-37279", "Description": "Faktory is a language-agnostic persistent background job server. Prior to version 1.8.0, the Faktory web dashboard can suffer from denial of service by a crafted malicious url query param `days`. The vulnerability is related to how the backend reads the `days` URL query parameter in the Faktory web dashboard. The value is used directly without any checks to create a string slice. If a very large value is provided, the backend server ends up using a significant amount of memory and causing it to crash. Version 1.8.0 fixes this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-37279", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nContribsys\u00bbFaktory\u00bbForGOVersions  before (<) 1.8.0cpe:2.3:a:contribsys:faktory:*:*:*:*:*:go:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-26  0.05%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-08-20  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-09-26  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-789 Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/789/Memory-Allocation-with-Excessive-Size-Value.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/contribsys/faktory/security/advisories/GHSA-x4hh-vjm7-g2jv", "ref_desc": "Faktory Web Dashboard can lead to denial of service(DOS) via malicious user input \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 contribsys/faktory \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
