{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-43650", "Description": "JumpServer is an open source bastion host. The verification code for resetting user's password is vulnerable to brute-force attacks due to the absence of rate limiting. JumpServer provides a feature allowing users to reset forgotten passwords. Affected users are sent a 6-digit verification code, ranging from 000000 to 999999, to facilitate the password reset. Although the code is only available in 1 minute, this window potentially allows for up to 1,000,000 validation attempts. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.28.20 and 3.7.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-43650", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFit2cloud\u00bbJumpserverVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andbefore (<) 3.7.1cpe:2.3:a:fit2cloud:jumpserver:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFit2cloud\u00bbJumpserverVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.28.20cpe:2.3:a:fit2cloud:jumpserver:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-29  0.14%  0.17%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-10-03  0.10%  0.14%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-08-27  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-10-03  0.04%  0.09%  +0.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-640 Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/640/Weak-Password-Recovery-Mechanism-for-Forgotten-Password.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/jumpserver/jumpserver/security/advisories/GHSA-mwx4-8fwc-2xvw", "ref_desc": "Non-MFA account takeover via brute-force attack on weak password reset code \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 jumpserver/jumpserver \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
