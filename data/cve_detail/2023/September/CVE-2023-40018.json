{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-40018", "Description": "FreeSWITCH is a Software Defined Telecom Stack enabling the digital transformation from proprietary telecom switches to a software implementation that runs on any commodity hardware. Prior to version 1.10.10, FreeSWITCH allows remote users to trigger out of bounds write by offering an ICE candidate with unknown component ID. When an SDP is offered with any ICE candidates with an unknown component ID, FreeSWITCH will make an out of bounds write to its  arrays. By abusing this vulnerability, an attacker is able to corrupt FreeSWITCH memory leading to an undefined behavior of the system or a crash of it. Version 1.10.10 contains a patch for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-40018", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nFreeswitch\u00bbFreeswitchVersions  before (<) 1.10.10cpe:2.3:a:freeswitch:freeswitch:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-17  0.15%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-09-21  0.09%  0.15%  +0.06 \n 3  2024-08-15  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-09-22  0.05%  0.08%  +0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch/security/advisories/GHSA-7mwp-86fv-hcg3", "ref_desc": "FreeSWITCH allows remote users to trigger out of bounds write by offering an ICE candidate with unknown component ID \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 signalwire/freeswitch \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch/releases/tag/v1.10.10", "ref_desc": "Release FreeSWITCH v1.10.10 Release \u00b7 signalwire/freeswitch \u00b7 GitHubRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Z_EsJvbnwngz9WYezLvMCxRwLcc.html"}]}
