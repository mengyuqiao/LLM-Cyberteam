{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-41374", "Description": "Double free issue exists in Kostac PLC Programming Software Version 1.6.11.0 and earlier. Arbitrary code may be executed by having a user open a specially crafted project file which was saved using Kostac PLC Programming Software Version 1.6.9.0 and earlier because the issue exists in parsing of KPP project files. The vendor states that Kostac PLC Programming Software Version 1.6.10.0 or later implements the function which prevents a project file alteration. Therefore, to mitigate the impact of these vulnerabilities, a project file which was saved using Kostac PLC Programming Software Version 1.6.9.0 and earlier needs to be saved again using Kostac PLC Programming Software Version 1.6.10.0 or later.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-41374", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nJtekt\u00bbKostac PlcVersions  before (<) 1.6.10.0cpe:2.3:a:jtekt:kostac_plc:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nJtekt\u00bbKostac Plc\u00bbVersion:1.6.11.0cpe:2.3:a:jtekt:kostac_plc:1.6.11.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-22  0.12%  0.09%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-03-27  0.16%  0.12%  -0.04 \n 3  2024-03-12  0.11%  0.16%  +0.05 \n 4  2023-10-30  0.13%  0.11%  -0.01 \n 5  2023-09-23  0.05%  0.13%  +0.08 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-415 Double Free", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/415/Double-Free.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.electronics.jtekt.co.jp/en/topics/202309125391/", "ref_desc": "[Update notice] Kostac PLC Programming Software (KPP)\uff5cJTEKT ELECTRONICS CORPORATIONVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/HEUqX8GhVAaf1s4pNmgEmMJBVgE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://jvn.jp/en/vu/JVNVU95282683/index.html", "ref_desc": "JVNVU#95282683: Multiple vulnerabilities in JTEKT ELECTRONICS Kostac PLC Programming SoftwareThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Jp2ttmGi9lVs-eRzOXWx62XcoK8.html"}]}
