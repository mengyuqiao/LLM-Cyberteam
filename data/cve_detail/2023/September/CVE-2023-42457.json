{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-42457", "Description": "plone.rest allows users to use HTTP verbs such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. in Plone. Starting in the 2.x branch and prior to versions 2.0.1 and 3.0.1, when the `++api++` traverser is accidentally used multiple times in a url, handling it takes increasingly longer, making the server less responsive. Patches are available in `plone.rest` 2.0.1 and 3.0.1.  Series 1.x is not affected. As a workaround, one may redirect `/++api++/++api++` to `/++api++` in one's frontend web server (nginx, Apache).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-42457", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPlone\u00bbRest\u00bbVersion:2.0.0cpe:2.3:a:plone:rest:2.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPlone\u00bbRest\u00bbVersion:3.0.0cpe:2.3:a:plone:rest:3.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-23  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-09-27  0.07%  0.10%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-08-21  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-09-26  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/09/22/2", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Plone security advisory 2023/09/21Mailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/8_y5fDUq_V12p6euCEuvjfep-3c.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/plone/plone.rest/commit/77846a9842889b24f35e8bedc2e9d461388d3302", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-h6rp-mprm-xgcq \u00b7 plone/plone.rest@77846a9 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/plone/plone.rest/commit/43b4a7e86206e237e1de5ca3817ed071575882f7", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-h6rp-mprm-xgcq \u00b7 plone/plone.rest@43b4a7e \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/plone/plone.rest/security/advisories/GHSA-h6rp-mprm-xgcq", "ref_desc": "Denial of Service when ++api++ is used many times \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 plone/plone.rest \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
