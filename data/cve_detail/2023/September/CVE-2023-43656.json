{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-43656", "Description": "matrix-hookshot is a Matrix bot for connecting to external services like GitHub, GitLab, JIRA, and more. Instances that have enabled transformation functions (those that have `generic.allowJsTransformationFunctions` in their config), may be vulnerable to an attack where it is possible to break out of the `vm2` sandbox and as a result Hookshot will be vulnerable to this. This problem is only likely to affect users who have allowed untrusted users to apply their own transformation functions. If you have only enabled a limited set of trusted users, this threat is reduced (though not eliminated). Version 4.5.0 and above of hookshot include a new sandbox library which should better protect users. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should disable `generic.allowJsTransformationFunctions` in the config.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-43656", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMatrix\u00bbHookshotVersions  before (<) 4.5.0cpe:2.3:a:matrix:hookshot:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 57 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-29  0.17%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-10-03  0.11%  0.17%  +0.06 \n 3  2024-08-27  0.09%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-10-06  0.04%  0.09%  +0.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/commit/dc126afa6af86d66aefcd23a825326f405bcc894", "ref_desc": "Replace vm2 with quickjs (#817) \u00b7 matrix-org/matrix-hookshot@dc126af \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/security/advisories/GHSA-fr97-pv6w-4cj6", "ref_desc": "Potential sandbox escape for instances that have enabled transformation functions \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 matrix-org/matrix-hookshot \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
