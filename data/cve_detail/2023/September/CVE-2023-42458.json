{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-42458", "Description": "Zope is an open-source web application server. Prior to versions 4.8.10 and 5.8.5, there is a stored cross site scripting vulnerability for SVG images. Note that an image tag with an SVG image as source is never vulnerable, even when the SVG image contains malicious code. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would first need to upload an image, and then trick a user into following a specially crafted link. Patches are available in Zope 4.8.10 and 5.8.5. As a workaround, make sure the \"Add Documents, Images, and Files\" permission is only assigned to trusted roles. By default, only the Manager has this permission.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-42458", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nZope\u00bbZopeVersions  before (<) 4.8.10cpe:2.3:a:zope:zope:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nZope\u00bbZopeVersions  from including (>=) 5.0.0andbefore (<) 5.8.5cpe:2.3:a:zope:zope:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-27  0.12%  0.09%  -0.03 \n 2  2024-08-21  0.11%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-06-02  0.08%  0.11%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-09-26  0.05%  0.08%  +0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-80 Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/80/Improper-Neutralization-of-Script-Related-HTML-Tags-in-a-Web.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/commit/603b0a12881c90a072a7a65e32d47ed898ce37cb", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-wm8q-9975-xh5v \u00b7 zopefoundation/Zope@603b0a1 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/09/22/2", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Plone security advisory 2023/09/21Exploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/8_y5fDUq_V12p6euCEuvjfep-3c.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/commit/26a55dbc301db417f47cafda6fe0f983b5690088", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-wm8q-9975-xh5v \u00b7 zopefoundation/Zope@26a55db \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/security/advisories/GHSA-wm8q-9975-xh5v", "ref_desc": "Stored Cross Site Scripting with SVG images \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 zopefoundation/Zope \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
