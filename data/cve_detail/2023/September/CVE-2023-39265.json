{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-39265", "Description": "Apache Superset would allow for SQLite database connections to be incorrectly registered when an attacker uses alternative driver names like\u00a0sqlite+pysqlite or by using database imports. This could allow for unexpected file creation on Superset webservers. Additionally, if Apache Superset is using a SQLite database for its metadata (not advised for production use) it could result in more severe vulnerabilities related to confidentiality and integrity.\u00a0This vulnerability exists in Apache Superset versions up to and including 2.1.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39265", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbSupersetVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.1.0cpe:2.3:a:apache:superset:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-08  0.20%  0.21%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-09-25  0.20%  0.20%  0.00 \n 3  2024-09-12  0.13%  0.20%  +0.07 \n 4  2023-09-13  0.04%  0.13%  +0.08 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/175094/Apache-Superset-2.0.0-Remote-Code-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "Apache Superset 2.0.0 Remote Code Execution \u2248 Packet StormCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/1svmD3_HCW5NerBU5PQsOHD_rEk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/pwdzsdmv4g5g1n2h9m7ortfnxmhr7nfy", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-39265: Apache Superset: Possible Unauthorized Registration of SQLite Database Connections-Apache Mail ArchivesVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
