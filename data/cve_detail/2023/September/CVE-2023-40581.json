{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-40581", "Description": "yt-dlp is a youtube-dl fork with additional features and fixes. yt-dlp allows the user to provide shell command lines to be executed at various stages in its download steps through the `--exec` flag. This flag allows output template expansion in its argument, so that metadata values may be used in the shell commands. The metadata fields can be combined with the `%q` conversion, which is intended to quote/escape these values so they can be safely passed to the shell. However, the escaping used for `cmd` (the shell used by Python's `subprocess` on Windows) does not properly escape special characters, which can allow for remote code execution if `--exec` is used directly with maliciously crafted remote data. This vulnerability only impacts `yt-dlp` on Windows, and the vulnerability is present regardless of whether `yt-dlp` is run from `cmd` or from `PowerShell`. Support for output template expansion in `--exec`, along with this vulnerable behavior, was added to `yt-dlp` in version 2021.04.11. yt-dlp version 2023.09.24 fixes this issue by properly escaping each special character. `\\n` will be replaced by `\\r` as no way of escaping it has been found. It is recommended to upgrade yt-dlp to version 2023.09.24 as soon as possible. Also, always be careful when using --exec, because while this specific vulnerability has been patched, using unvalidated input in shell commands is inherently dangerous. For Windows users who are not able to upgrade: 1. Avoid using any output template expansion in --exec other than {} (filepath). 2. If expansion in --exec is needed, verify the fields you are using do not contain \", | or &. 3. Instead of using --exec, write the info json and load the fields from it instead.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-40581", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nYt-dlp Project\u00bbYt-dlpVersions  from including (>=) 2021.04.11andbefore (<) 2023.09.24cpe:2.3:a:yt-dlp_project:yt-dlp:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.79% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 82 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-27  0.75%  0.79%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-10-01  0.53%  0.75%  +0.22 \n 3  2023-09-28  0.20%  0.53%  +0.33 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/security/advisories/GHSA-42h4-v29r-42qg", "ref_desc": "`--exec` command injection when using `%q` in yt-dlp on Windows \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 yt-dlp/yt-dlp \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Mitigation;Patch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/HB8JoyclKHO_SguBh4PCXt2NkaY.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp-nightly-builds/releases/tag/2023.09.24.003044", "ref_desc": "Release yt-dlp nightly 2023.09.24.003044 \u00b7 yt-dlp/yt-dlp-nightly-builds \u00b7 GitHubProduct;Release Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/commit/de015e930747165dbb8fcd360f8775fd973b7d6e", "ref_desc": "[core] Prevent RCE when using `--exec` with `%q` (CVE-2023-40581) \u00b7 yt-dlp/yt-dlp@de015e9 \u00b7 GitHubPatchCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/wqI2IZsrmK15QE7rl01atbcAFIA.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/tag/2021.04.11", "ref_desc": "Release yt-dlp 2021.04.11 \u00b7 yt-dlp/yt-dlp \u00b7 GitHubProduct;Release NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/xj5W2QUsIW1j2B9C0cDKK4t9Nlc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/tag/2023.09.24", "ref_desc": "Release yt-dlp 2023.09.24 \u00b7 yt-dlp/yt-dlp \u00b7 GitHubProduct;Release Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
