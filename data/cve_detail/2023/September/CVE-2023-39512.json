{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-39512", "Description": "Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault management framework. Affected versions are subject to a Stored Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability which allows an authenticated user to poison data stored in the _cacti_'s database. These data will be viewed by administrative _cacti_ accounts and execute JavaScript code in the victim's browser at view-time. The script under `data_sources.php` displays the data source management information (e.g. data source path, polling configuration, device name related to the datasource etc.) for different data visualizations of the _cacti_ app. _CENSUS_ found that an adversary that is able to configure a malicious device name, can deploy a stored XSS attack against any user of the same (or broader) privileges. A user that possesses the _General Administration>Sites/Devices/Data_ permissions can configure the device names in _cacti_. This configuration occurs through `http://<HOST>/cacti/host.php`, while the rendered malicious payload is exhibited at `http://<HOST>/cacti/data_sources.php`. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 1.2.25. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to update should manually filter HTML output.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39512", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:37cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:37:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:38cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:38:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCacti\u00bbCactiVersions  before (<) 1.2.25cpe:2.3:a:cacti:cacti:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 34 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-11  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-08-05  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-11-05  0.10%  0.06%  -0.04 \n 4  2023-10-21  0.05%  0.10%  +0.05 \n 5  2023-10-13  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-09-09  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WZGB2UXJEUYWWA6IWVFQ3ZTP22FIHMGN/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 37 Update: cacti-1.2.25-1.fc37 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing ListCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/6aIxv82e5IY6_r-lb23U1ODhhQc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5550", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-5550-1 cactiCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/CBbBi-KrXVzXrDwO_p9S-OFy158.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-vqcc-5v63-g9q7", "ref_desc": "Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability with Device Name when managing Data Sources \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Cacti/cacti \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CFH3J2WVBKY4ZJNMARVOWJQK6PSLPHFH/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 38 Update: cacti-spine-1.2.25-1.fc38 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing ListCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/zFZvmZkNPojOfQaIACeRopThois.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WOQFYGLZBAWT4AWNMO7DU73QXWPXTCKH/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 39 Update: cacti-spine-1.2.25-1.fc39 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ZqKQgYJqIOOz-6L1kKhMZx982Ms.html"}]}
