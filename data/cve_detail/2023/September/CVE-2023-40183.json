{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-40183", "Description": "DataEase is an open source data visualization and analysis tool. Prior to version 1.18.11, DataEase has a vulnerability that allows an attacker to to obtain user cookies. The program only uses the `ImageIO.read()` method to determine whether the file is an image file or not. There is no whitelisting restriction on file suffixes. This allows the attacker to synthesize the attack code into an image for uploading and change the file extension to html. The attacker may steal user cookies by accessing links. The vulnerability has been fixed in v1.18.11. There are no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-40183", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDataease\u00bbDataeaseVersions  before (<) 1.18.11cpe:2.3:a:dataease:dataease:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-23  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-09-27  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-08-21  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-09-27  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/dataease/dataease/commit/826513053146721a2b3e09a9c9d3ea41f8f10569", "ref_desc": "fix: \u52a0\u5f3a\u56fe\u7247\u6821\u9a8c\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u6076\u610f\u4ee3\u7801\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u5230\u56fe\u7247\u4e0a\u4f20\u5230\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4e2d\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u884c\u4e3a \u00b7 dataease/dataease@8265130 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dataease/dataease/security/advisories/GHSA-w2r4-2r4w-fjxv", "ref_desc": "DataEase has a vulnerability to obtain user cookies \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 dataease/dataease \u00b7 GitHubExploit", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dataease/dataease/releases/tag/v1.18.11", "ref_desc": "Release v1.18.11 \u00b7 dataease/dataease \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
