{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-43657", "Description": "discourse-encrypt is a plugin that provides a secure communication channel through Discourse. Improper escaping of encrypted topic titles could lead to a cross site scripting (XSS) issue when a site has content security policy (CSP) headers disabled. Having CSP disabled is a non-default configuration, and having it disabled with discourse-encrypt installed will result in a warning in the Discourse admin dashboard. This has been fixed in commit `9c75810af9` which is included in the latest version of the discourse-encrypt plugin. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that CSP headers are enabled and properly configured.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-43657", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse-encrypt\u00bbForDiscourseVersions  before (<) 2023-09-28cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse-encrypt:*:*:*:*:*:discourse:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 35 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-30  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-04  0.06%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-08-28  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-10-03  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse-encrypt/security/advisories/GHSA-5fh6-wp7p-xx7v", "ref_desc": "Improper escaping of encrypted topic titles can lead to XSS under non-default site configuration \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 discourse/discourse-encrypt \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse-encrypt/commit/9c75810af9a474d7edaec67dea66f852c0ba1f4e", "ref_desc": "SECURITY: Properly escape encrypted topic titles (#283) \u00b7 discourse/discourse-encrypt@9c75810 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP", "ref_desc": "Content Security Policy (CSP) - HTTP | MDNProductCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Y8KFbSVDaGCBboTYz8jPUezvzNA.html"}]}
