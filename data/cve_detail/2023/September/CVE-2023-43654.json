{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-43654", "Description": "TorchServe is a tool for serving and scaling PyTorch models in production. TorchServe default configuration lacks proper input validation, enabling third parties to invoke remote HTTP download requests and write files to the disk. This issue could be taken advantage of to compromise the integrity of the system and sensitive data. This issue is present in versions 0.1.0 to 0.8.1. A user is able to load the model of their choice from any URL that they would like to use. The user of TorchServe is responsible for configuring both the allowed_urls and specifying the model URL to be used. A pull request to warn the user when the default value for allowed_urls is used has been merged in PR #2534. TorchServe release 0.8.2 includes this change. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-43654", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nPytorch\u00bbTorchserveVersions  from including (>=) 0.1.0andbefore (<) 0.8.2cpe:2.3:a:pytorch:torchserve:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "13.43% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 96 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-11  14.47%  13.43%  -1.04 \n 2  2024-10-30  16.56%  14.47%  -2.09 \n 3  2024-10-04  12.05%  16.56%  +4.51 \n 4  2024-09-23  13.30%  12.05%  -1.25 \n 5  2024-09-19  0.17%  13.30%  +13.13 \n 6  2024-08-28  0.14%  0.17%  +0.03 \n 7  2024-06-09  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 8  2024-04-22  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 9  2023-11-01  0.05%  0.11%  +0.06 \n 10  2023-10-13  0.07%  0.05%  -0.02 \n 11  2023-10-03  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pytorch/serve/security/advisories/GHSA-8fxr-qfr9-p34w", "ref_desc": "TorchServe SSRF \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pytorch/serve \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/2534", "ref_desc": "Issue warning about allowed_urls when default value is used by namannandan \u00b7 Pull Request #2534 \u00b7 pytorch/serve \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pytorch/serve/releases/tag/v0.8.2", "ref_desc": "Release TorchServe v0.8.2 Release Notes \u00b7 pytorch/serve \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/175095/PyTorch-Model-Server-Registration-Deserialization-Remote-Code-Execution.html", "ref_desc": "PyTorch Model Server Registration / Deserialization Remote Code Execution \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/JwUcJ_KWOAzk1Vwh9-C9_y_6A9Y.html"}]}
