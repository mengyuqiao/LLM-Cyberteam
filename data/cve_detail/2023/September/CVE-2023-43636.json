{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-43636", "Description": "In EVE OS, the \u201cmeasured boot\u201d mechanism prevents a compromised device from accessing\nthe encrypted data located in the vault.\n\nAs per the \u201cmeasured boot\u201d design, the PCR values calculated at different stages of the boot\nprocess will change if any of their respective parts are changed.\n\nThis includes, among other things, the configuration of the bios, grub, the kernel cmdline,\ninitrd, and more.\n\nHowever, this mechanism does not validate the entire rootfs, so an attacker can edit the\nfilesystem and gain control over the system.\n\nAs the default filesystem used by EVE OS is squashfs, this is somewhat harder than an ext4,\nwhich is easily changeable.\n\nThis will not stop an attacker, as an attacker can repackage the squashfs with their changes\nin it and replace the partition altogether.\n\nThis can also be done directly on the device, as the \u201c003-storage-init\u201d container contains the\n\u201cmksquashfs\u201d and \u201cunsquashfs\u201d binaries (with the corresponding libs).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn attacker can gain full control over the device without changing the PCR values, thus not\ntriggering the \u201cmeasured boot\u201d mechanism, and having full access to the vault.\n\n\n\nNote:\n\nThis issue was partially fixed in these commits (after disclosure to Zededa), where the config\npartition measurement was added to PCR13:\n\n\u2022 aa3501d6c57206ced222c33aea15a9169d629141\n\n\u2022 5fef4d92e75838cc78010edaed5247dfbdae1889.\n\nThis issue was made viable in version 9.0.0 when the calculation was moved to PCR14 but it was not included in the measured boot.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-43636", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbEdge Virtualization EngineVersions  before (<) 8.6.0cpe:2.3:o:linuxfoundation:edge_virtualization_engine:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLinuxfoundation\u00bbEdge Virtualization EngineVersions  from including (>=) 9.0.0andbefore (<) 9.5.0cpe:2.3:o:linuxfoundation:edge_virtualization_engine:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 7 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-345 Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/345/Insufficient-Verification-of-Data-Authenticity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://asrg.io/security-advisories/cve-2023-43636/", "ref_desc": "Rootfs Not Protected - Automotive Security Research Group", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://asrg.io/security-advisories/19274/", "ref_desc": "Rootfs Not Protected - Automotive Security Research GroupThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
