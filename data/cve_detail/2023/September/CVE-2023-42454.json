{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-42454", "Description": "SQLpage is a SQL-only webapp builder. Someone using SQLpage versions prior to 0.11.1, whose SQLpage instance is exposed publicly, with a database connection string specified in the `sqlpage/sqlpage.json` configuration file (not in an environment variable), with the web_root is the current working directory (the default), and with their database exposed publicly, is vulnerable to an attacker retrieving database connection information from SQLPage and using it to connect to their database directly. Version 0.11.0 fixes this issue. Some workarounds are available. Using an environment variable instead of the configuration file to specify the database connection string prevents exposing it on vulnerable versions. Using a different web root (that is not a parent of the SQLPage configuration directory) fixes the issue. One should also avoid exposing one's database publicly.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-42454", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nLovasoa\u00bbSqlpageVersions  before (<) 0.11.1cpe:2.3:a:lovasoa:sqlpage:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-20  0.13%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-09-24  0.08%  0.13%  +0.05 \n 3  2024-08-18  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-09-21  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/lovasoa/SQLpage/security/advisories/GHSA-v5wf-jg37-r9m5", "ref_desc": "Public exposure of database credentials \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 lovasoa/SQLpage \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/lovasoa/SQLpage/releases/tag/v0.11.1", "ref_desc": "Release v0.11.1 \u00b7 lovasoa/SQLpage \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/lovasoa/SQLpage/issues/89", "ref_desc": "The sqlpage folder can be read by HTTP client requests \u00b7 Issue #89 \u00b7 lovasoa/SQLpage \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
