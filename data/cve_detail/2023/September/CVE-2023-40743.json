{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-40743", "Description": "** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** When integrating Apache Axis 1.x in an application, it may not have been obvious that looking up a service through \"ServiceFactory.getService\" allows potentially dangerous lookup mechanisms such as LDAP. When passing untrusted input to this API method, this could expose the application to DoS, SSRF and even attacks leading to RCE.\n\nAs Axis 1 has been EOL we recommend you migrate to a different SOAP engine, such as Apache Axis 2/Java. As a workaround, you may review your code to verify no untrusted or unsanitized input is passed to \"ServiceFactory.getService\", or by applying the patch from  https://github.com/apache/axis-axis1-java/commit/7e66753427466590d6def0125e448d2791723210 . The Apache Axis project does not expect to create an Axis 1.x release fixing this problem, though contributors that would like to work towards this are welcome.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-40743", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF);Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbAxisVersions  before (<) 2023-08-01cpe:2.3:a:apache:axis:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.32% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 71 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-07  0.29%  0.32%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-09-24  0.29%  0.29%  0.00 \n 3  2024-09-11  0.19%  0.29%  +0.10 \n 4  2023-10-18  0.07%  0.19%  +0.12 \n 5  2023-10-07  0.10%  0.07%  -0.03 \n 6  2023-09-12  0.04%  0.10%  +0.06 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-75 Failure to Sanitize Special Elements into a Different Plane (Special Element Injection)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/75/Failure-to-Sanitize-Special-Elements-into-a-Different-Plane-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/gs0qgk2mgss7zfhzdd6ftfjvm4kp7v82", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-40743: Apache Axis 1.x (EOL) may allow RCE when untrusted input is passed to getService-Apache Mail ArchivesIssue Tracking;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00025.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 3622-1] axis security update", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/apache/axis-axis1-java/commit/7e66753427466590d6def0125e448d2791723210", "ref_desc": "Filter out unsupported protocols in the client class ServiceFactory \u00b7 apache/axis-axis1-java@7e66753 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
