{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-41329", "Description": "WireMock is a tool for mocking HTTP services. The proxy mode of WireMock, can be protected by the network restrictions configuration, as documented in Preventing proxying to and recording from specific target addresses. These restrictions can be configured using the domain names, and in such a case the configuration is vulnerable to the DNS rebinding attacks. A similar patch was applied in WireMock 3.0.0-beta-15 for the WireMock Webhook Extensions. The root cause of the attack is a defect in the logic which allows for a race condition triggered by a DNS server whose address expires in between the initial validation and the outbound network request that might go to a domain that was supposed to be prohibited. Control over a DNS service is required to exploit this attack, so it has high execution complexity and limited impact. This issue has been addressed in version 2.35.1 of wiremock-jre8 and wiremock-jre8-standalone, version 3.0.3 of wiremock and wiremock-standalone, version 2.6.1 of the python version of wiremock, and versions 2.35.1-1 and 3.0.3-1 of the wiremock/wiremock Docker container. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should either configure firewall rules to define the list of permitted destinations or to configure WireMock to use IP addresses instead of the domain names.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-41329", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nWiremock\u00bbWiremockVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andbefore (<) 3.0.3cpe:2.3:a:wiremock:wiremock:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nWiremock\u00bbWiremockVersions  before (<) 2.35.1cpe:2.3:a:wiremock:wiremock:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nWiremock\u00bbStudioVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.32.0-17cpe:2.3:a:wiremock:studio:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nWiremock\u00bbPython WiremockVersions  before (<) 2.6.1cpe:2.3:a:wiremock:python_wiremock:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nWiremock\u00bbWiremock DockerVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.35.1-1cpe:2.3:a:wiremock:wiremock_docker:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nWiremock\u00bbWiremock DockerVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andbefore (<) 3.0.3-1cpe:2.3:a:wiremock:wiremock_docker:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 31 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-12  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-08-06  0.07%  0.06%  -0.01 \n 3  2023-09-13  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-290 Authentication Bypass by Spoofing", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/290/Authentication-Bypass-by-Spoofing.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/wiremock/wiremock/security/advisories/GHSA-pmxq-pj47-j8j4", "ref_desc": "Domain restrictions bypass via DNS Rebinding in WireMock and WireMock Studio webhooks, proxy and recorder modes \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 wiremock/wiremock \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://wiremock.org/docs/configuration/#preventing-proxying-to-and-recording-from-specific-target-addresses", "ref_desc": "Configuring WireMock in Java | WireMockProductCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/PajUeq2qam97np-YzAMUFfRVb3I.html"}]}
