{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-44124", "Description": "The vulnerability is to theft of arbitrary files with system privilege in the Screen recording (\"com.lge.gametools.gamerecorder\") app in the \"com/lge/gametools/gamerecorder/settings/ProfilePreferenceFragment.java\" file. The main problem is that the app launches implicit intents that can be intercepted by third-party apps installed on the same device. They also can return arbitrary data that will be passed to the \"onActivityResult()\" method. The Screen recording app saves contents of arbitrary URIs to SD card which is a world-readable storage.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-44124", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbAndroid\u00bbVersion:12.0cpe:2.3:o:google:android:12.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:LG\u00bbV60 Thin Q 5g\u00bbVersion:N/A\nGoogle\u00bbAndroid\u00bbVersion:13.0cpe:2.3:o:google:android:13.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:LG\u00bbV60 Thin Q 5g\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 11 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-10-03  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-668 Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/668/Exposure-of-Resource-to-Wrong-Sphere.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-927 Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/927/Use-of-Implicit-Intent-for-Sensitive-Communication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lgsecurity.lge.com/bulletins/mobile#updateDetails", "ref_desc": "LG Product SecurityVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/eX6AFEmVpSD0q7ViFSePae6g0Zc.html"}]}
