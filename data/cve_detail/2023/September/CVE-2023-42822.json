{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-42822", "Description": "xrdp is an open source remote desktop protocol server. Access to the font glyphs in xrdp_painter.c is not bounds-checked . Since some of this data is controllable by the user, this can result in an out-of-bounds read within the xrdp executable. The vulnerability allows an out-of-bounds read within a potentially privileged process. On non-Debian platforms, xrdp tends to run as root. Potentially an out-of-bounds write can follow the out-of-bounds read. There is no denial-of-service impact, providing xrdp is running in forking mode. This issue has been addressed in release 0.9.23.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-42822", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:37cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:37:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:38cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:38:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNeutrinolabs\u00bbXrdpVersions  before (<) 0.9.23.1cpe:2.3:a:neutrinolabs:xrdp:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-03  0.07%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-08-27  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-10-19  0.07%  0.06%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-10-06  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-10-03  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/neutrinolabs/xrdp/commit/73acbe1f7957c65122b00de4d6f57a8d0d257c40", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-2hjx-rm4f-r9hw \u00b7 neutrinolabs/xrdp@73acbe1 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RTXODUR4ILM7ZPA6ZGY6VSK4BBSBMKGY/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 37 Update: xrdp-0.9.23.1-1.fc37 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Release Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/5FPGA4M7IYCP7OILDF2ZJEVSXUOFEFQ6/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 39 Update: xrdp-0.9.23.1-1.fc39 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/neutrinolabs/xrdp/security/advisories/GHSA-2hjx-rm4f-r9hw", "ref_desc": "Unchecked access to font glyph info \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 neutrinolabs/xrdp \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PFGL22QQF65OIZRMCKUZCVJQCKGUBRYE/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 38 Update: xrdp-0.9.23.1-1.fc38 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Release Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
