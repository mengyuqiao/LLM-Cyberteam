{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-41081", "Description": "Important: Authentication Bypass CVE-2023-41081\n\nThe mod_jk component of Apache Tomcat Connectors\u00a0in some circumstances, such as when a configuration included\u00a0\"JkOptions +ForwardDirectories\" but the configuration did not       provide explicit mounts for all possible proxied requests, mod_jk would       use an implicit mapping and map the request to the first defined worker.\u00a0Such an implicit mapping could result in the unintended exposure of the\u00a0status worker and/or bypass security constraints configured in httpd. As\u00a0of JK 1.2.49, the implicit mapping functionality has been removed and all\u00a0mappings must now be via explicit configuration.\u00a0Only mod_jk is affected\u00a0by this issue. The ISAPI redirector is not affected.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Tomcat Connectors (mod_jk only): from 1.2.0 through 1.2.48.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 1.2.49, which fixes the issue.\n\nHistory\n2023-09-13 Original advisory\n\n2023-09-28 Updated summary", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-41081", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbTomcat ConnectorsVersions  from including (>=) 1.2.0andbefore (<) 1.2.49cpe:2.3:a:apache:tomcat_connectors:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 56 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-27  0.20%  0.18%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-10-15  0.23%  0.20%  -0.03 \n 3  2024-10-02  0.24%  0.23%  0.00 \n 4  2024-09-19  0.12%  0.24%  +0.11 \n 5  2024-08-13  0.09%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 6  2024-03-20  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-10-16  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 8  2023-09-29  0.14%  0.06%  -0.08 \n 9  2023-09-25  0.16%  0.14%  -0.02 \n 10  2023-09-16  0.04%  0.16%  +0.11 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/09/13/2", "ref_desc": "oss-security - [SECURITY] CVE-2023-41081 Apache Tomcat Connectors (mod_jk) Information DisclosureMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/09/13/2", "ref_desc": "oss-security - [SECURITY] CVE-2023-41081 Apache Tomcat Connectors (mod_jk) Information Disclosure", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/09/msg00027.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 3580-1] libapache-mod-jk security update", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/rd1r26w7271jyqgzr4492tooyt583d8b", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] CVE-2023-41081 Apache Tomcat Connectors (mod_jk) Information Disclosure-Apache Mail ArchivesMailing List", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/09/28/7", "ref_desc": "oss-security - CVE-2023-41081: Apache Tomcat Connectors: Unexpected use of first declared worker in mod_jk for unmapped request [CORRECTION]", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
