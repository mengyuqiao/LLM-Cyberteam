{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-42453", "Description": "Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver written and maintained by the Matrix.org Foundation. Users were able to forge read receipts for any event (if they knew the room ID and event ID). Note that the users were not able to view the events, but simply mark it as read. This could be confusing as clients will show the event as read by the user, even if they are not in the room. This issue has been patched in version 1.93.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-42453", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nMatrix\u00bbSynapseVersions  from including (>=) 1.34.0andbefore (<) 1.93.0cpe:2.3:a:matrix:synapse:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:37cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:37:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:38cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:38:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 35 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-02  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-08-26  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-01-10  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-10-19  0.06%  0.05%  -0.01 \n 5  2023-10-06  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-10-01  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-285 Improper Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/285/Improper-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2AFB2Y3S2VCPCN5P2XCZTG24MBMZ7DM4/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 37 Update: matrix-synapse-1.80.0-6.fc37 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Release NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/EDb5I7jyv7OgERcwDmLD1jojebw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-7565-cq32-vx2x", "ref_desc": "Improper validation of receipts allows forged read receipts \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 matrix-org/synapse \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202401-12", "ref_desc": "Synapse: Multiple Vulnerabilities (GLSA 202401-12) \u2014 Gentoo securityCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/JE1VEBRtwAveapniePTKkBogBqE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/65QPC55I4D27HIZP7H2NQ34EOXHPP4AO/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 38 Update: matrix-synapse-1.93.0-2.fc38 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Release NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/pEFmVjL0fWLEReRp7NveADReOuI.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/16327", "ref_desc": "Additional validation of receipts by clokep \u00b7 Pull Request #16327 \u00b7 matrix-org/synapse \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/N6P4QULVUE254WI7XF2LWWOGHCYVFXFY/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 39 Update: matrix-synapse-1.94.0-2.fc39 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/TjRnFi9Q7OZ6U3zQjzkWf7nfxsw.html"}]}
