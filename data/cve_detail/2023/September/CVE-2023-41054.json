{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-41054", "Description": "LibreY is a fork of LibreX, a framework-less and javascript-free privacy respecting meta search engine. LibreY is subject to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the `image_proxy.php` file of LibreY before commit 8f9b9803f231e2954e5b49987a532d28fe50a627. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to use the server as a proxy to send HTTP GET requests to arbitrary targets and retrieve information in the internal network or conduct Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks via the `url` parameter. Remote attackers can use the server as a proxy to send HTTP GET requests and retrieve information in the internal network. Remote attackers can also request the server to download large files or chain requests among multiple instances to reduce the performance of the server or even deny access from legitimate users. This issue has been addressed in https://github.com/Ahwxorg/LibreY/pull/31. LibreY hosters are advised to use the latest commit. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-41054", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF);Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nAhwx\u00bbLibreyVersions  before (<) 2023-08-29cpe:2.3:a:ahwx:librey:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.30% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 70 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-06  0.27%  0.30%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-09-10  0.17%  0.27%  +0.10 \n 3  2024-08-04  0.14%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-09-09  0.05%  0.14%  +0.10 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Ahwxorg/LibreY/security/advisories/GHSA-p4f9-h8x8-mpwf", "ref_desc": "LibreY Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in image_proxy.php \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Ahwxorg/LibreY \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Ahwxorg/LibreY/pull/31", "ref_desc": "irresponsible disclosure by codedipper \u00b7 Pull Request #31 \u00b7 Ahwxorg/LibreY \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
