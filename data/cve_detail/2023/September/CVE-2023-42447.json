{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-42447", "Description": "blurhash-rs is a pure Rust implementation of Blurhash, software for encoding images into ASCII strings that can be turned into a gradient of colors representing the original image. In version 0.1.1, the blurhash parsing code may panic due to multiple panic-guarded out-of-bounds accesses on untrusted input. In a typical deployment, this may get triggered by feeding a maliciously crafted blurhashes over the network. These may include UTF-8 compliant strings containing multi-byte UTF-8 characters. A patch is available in version 0.2.0, which requires user intervention because of slight API churn. No known workarounds are available.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-42447", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nWhisperfish\u00bbBlurhash-rs\u00bbVersion:0.1.1ForRustcpe:2.3:a:whisperfish:blurhash-rs:0.1.1:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-25  0.05%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-08-19  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-09-23  0.05%  0.04%  -0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-248 Uncaught Exception", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/248/Uncaught-Exception.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-392 Missing Report of Error Condition", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/392/Missing-Report-of-Error-Condition.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1284 Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1284/Improper-Validation-of-Specified-Quantity-in-Input.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/whisperfish/blurhash-rs/security/advisories/GHSA-cxvp-82cq-57h2", "ref_desc": "panic on parsing crafted blurhash inputs \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 whisperfish/blurhash-rs \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
