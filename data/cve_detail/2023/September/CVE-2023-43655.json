{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-43655", "Description": "Composer is a dependency manager for PHP. Users publishing a composer.phar to a public web-accessible server where the composer.phar can be executed as a php file may be subject to a remote code execution vulnerability if PHP also has `register_argc_argv` enabled in php.ini. Versions 2.6.4, 2.2.22 and 1.10.27 patch this vulnerability. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should make sure `register_argc_argv` is disabled in php.ini, and avoid publishing composer.phar to the web as this is not best practice.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-43655", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:37cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:37:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:38cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:38:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGetcomposer\u00bbComposerVersions  from including (>=) 2.3.0andbefore (<) 2.6.4cpe:2.3:a:getcomposer:composer:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGetcomposer\u00bbComposerVersions  before (<) 1.10.27cpe:2.3:a:getcomposer:composer:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGetcomposer\u00bbComposerVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.2.21cpe:2.3:a:getcomposer:composer:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 85 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-31  0.89%  1.13%  +0.25 \n 2  2024-10-05  0.56%  0.89%  +0.33 \n 3  2024-08-29  0.48%  0.56%  +0.08 \n 4  2024-03-21  0.37%  0.48%  +0.11 \n 5  2023-11-05  0.32%  0.37%  +0.04 \n 6  2023-10-15  0.16%  0.32%  +0.16 \n 7  2023-10-04  0.06%  0.16%  +0.10 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/66H2WKFUO255T3BZTL72TNYJYH2XM5FG/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 39 Update: composer-2.6.5-1.fc39 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/03/msg00030.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 3777-1] composer security update", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/composer/composer/commit/955a48e6319c8962e5cd421b07c00ab3c728968c", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-jm6m-4632-36hf \u00b7 composer/composer@955a48e \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/composer/composer/security/advisories/GHSA-jm6m-4632-36hf", "ref_desc": "Remote Code Execution via web-accessible composer.phar \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 composer/composer \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/composer/composer/commit/4fce14795aba98e40b6c4f5047305aba17a6120d", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-jm6m-4632-36hf \u00b7 composer/composer@4fce147 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KFOPGPW2KS37O3KJWBRGTUWHTXCQXBS2/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 37 Update: composer-2.6.5-1.fc37 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/7AWYAUZNH565NWPIKGEIYBWHYNM5JGAE/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 38 Update: composer-2.6.5-1.fc38 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/composer/composer/commit/95e091c921037b7b6564942845e7b738f6b95c9c", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-jm6m-4632-36hf \u00b7 composer/composer@95e091c \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
