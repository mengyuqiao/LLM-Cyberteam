{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-31132", "Description": "Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault management framework. Affected versions are subject to a privilege escalation vulnerability. A low-privileged OS user with access to a Windows host where Cacti is installed can create arbitrary PHP files in a web document directory. The user can then execute the PHP files under the security context of SYSTEM. This allows an attacker to escalate privilege from a normal user account to SYSTEM. This issue has been addressed in version 1.2.25. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-31132", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nCacti\u00bbCactiVersions  before (<) 1.2.25cpe:2.3:a:cacti:cacti:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 5 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-11  0.06%  0.04%  -0.02 \n 2  2023-10-13  0.04%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WZGB2UXJEUYWWA6IWVFQ3ZTP22FIHMGN/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 37 Update: cacti-1.2.25-1.fc37 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing ListCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/6aIxv82e5IY6_r-lb23U1ODhhQc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-rf5w-pq3f-9876", "ref_desc": "Privilege escalation when Cacti installed using Windows Installer defaults \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Cacti/cacti \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CFH3J2WVBKY4ZJNMARVOWJQK6PSLPHFH/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 38 Update: cacti-spine-1.2.25-1.fc38 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing ListCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/zFZvmZkNPojOfQaIACeRopThois.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WOQFYGLZBAWT4AWNMO7DU73QXWPXTCKH/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 39 Update: cacti-spine-1.2.25-1.fc39 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ZqKQgYJqIOOz-6L1kKhMZx982Ms.html"}]}
