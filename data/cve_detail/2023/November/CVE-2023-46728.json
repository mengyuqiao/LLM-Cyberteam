Due to a NULL pointer dereference bug Squid is vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack against Squid's Gopher gateway. The gopher protocol is always available and enabled in Squid prior to Squid 6.0.1. Responses triggering this bug are possible to be received from any gopher server, even those without malicious intent. Gopher support has been removed in Squid version 6.0.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should reject all gopher URL requests.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46728", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nSquid-cache\u00bbSquidVersions  before (<) 6.0.1cpe:2.3:a:squid-cache:squid:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.45% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 76 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-12  0.31%  0.45%  +0.13 \n 2  2024-10-18  0.33%  0.31%  -0.02 \n 3  2024-10-06  0.37%  0.33%  -0.04 \n 4  2023-12-29  0.34%  0.37%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-12-15  0.22%  0.34%  +0.12 \n 6  2023-11-15  0.04%  0.22%  +0.18 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/476/NULL-Pointer-Dereference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231214-0006/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-46728 Squid Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product Security", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MEV66D3PAAY6K7TWDT3WZBLCPLASFJDC/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 38 Update: squid-6.6-1.fc38 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/FjM_ivaLWkQliv1_2UA4s5WeYZE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/commit/6ea12e8fb590ac6959e9356a81aa3370576568c3", "ref_desc": "Remove support for Gopher protocol (#1092) \u00b7 squid-cache/squid@6ea12e8 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/security/advisories/GHSA-cg5h-v6vc-w33f", "ref_desc": "SQUID-2021:8 Denial of Service in Gopher gateway \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 squid-cache/squid \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/A5QASTMCUSUEW3UOMKHZJB3FTONWSRXS/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 39 Update: squid-6.6-1.fc39 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/MGLW25pXXP02s4oZPRGw5kGuk2M.html"}]}
