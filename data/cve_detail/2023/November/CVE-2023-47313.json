{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-47313", "Description": "Headwind MDM Web panel 5.22.1 is vulnerable to Directory Traversal. The application uses an API call to move the uploaded temporary file to the file directory during the file upload process. This API call receives two input parameters, such as path and localPath. The first one refers to the temporary file with an absolute path without validating it. Attackers may modify this API call by referring to arbitrary files. As a result, arbitrary files can be moved to the files directory and so they can be downloaded.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-47313", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nH-mdm\u00bbHeadwind Mdm\u00bbVersion:5.22.1cpe:2.3:a:h-mdm:headwind_mdm:5.22.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 26 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-28  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-22  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-11-30  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://boltonshield.com/en/cve/cve-2023-47313/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-47313 \u2013 Headwind MDM Web panel 5.22.1 \u2013 File Reading via Uncontrolled File Operation - BoltonshieldExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
