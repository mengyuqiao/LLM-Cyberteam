{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-47637", "Description": "Pimcore is an Open Source Data & Experience Management Platform. In affected versions the `/admin/object/grid-proxy` endpoint calls `getFilterCondition()` on fields of classes to be filtered for, passing input from the request, and later executes the returned SQL.  One implementation of `getFilterCondition()` is in `Multiselect`, which does not normalize/escape/validate the passed value. Any backend user with very basic permissions can execute arbitrary SQL statements and thus alter any data or escalate their privileges to at least admin level. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 11.1.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-47637", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nPimcore\u00bbPimcoreVersions  before (<) 11.1.1cpe:2.3:a:pimcore:pimcore:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-21  0.07%  0.13%  +0.06 \n 2  2024-10-15  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-09-21  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-11-23  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/commit/d164d99c90f098d0ccd6b72929c48b727e2953a0", "ref_desc": "Fix: escape filter values \u00b7 pimcore/pimcore@d164d99 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle/blob/bba7c7419cb1f06d5fd98781eab4d6995e4e5dca/src/Helper/GridHelperService.php#L311", "ref_desc": "admin-ui-classic-bundle/src/Helper/GridHelperService.php at bba7c7419cb1f06d5fd98781eab4d6995e4e5dca \u00b7 pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/security/advisories/GHSA-72hh-xf79-429p", "ref_desc": "SQL Injection in Admin Grid Filter API through Multiselect::getFilterConditionExt() \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pimcore/pimcore \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
