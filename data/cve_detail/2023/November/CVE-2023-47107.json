{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-47107", "Description": "PILOS is an open source front-end for BigBlueButton servers with a built-in load balancer. The password reset component deployed within PILOS uses the hostname supplied within the request host header when building a password reset URL. It may be possible to manipulate the URL sent to PILOS users when so that it points to the attackers server thereby disclosing the password reset token if/when the link is followed. This only affects local user accounts and requires the password reset option to be enabled. This issue has been patched in version 2.3.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-47107", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nTHM\u00bbPilosVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.3.0cpe:2.3:a:thm:pilos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-14  0.11%  0.17%  +0.06 \n 2  2024-10-08  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-12-10  0.12%  0.09%  -0.03 \n 4  2023-11-17  0.04%  0.12%  +0.08 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-640 Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/640/Weak-Password-Recovery-Mechanism-for-Forgotten-Password.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/THM-Health/PILOS/security/advisories/GHSA-mc6f-fj9h-5735", "ref_desc": "Account takeover through password reset poisoning \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 THM-Health/PILOS \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
