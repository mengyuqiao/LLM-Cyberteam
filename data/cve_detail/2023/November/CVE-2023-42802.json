{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-42802", "Description": "GLPI is a free asset and IT management software package. Starting in version 10.0.7 and prior to version 10.0.10, an unverified object instantiation allows one to upload malicious PHP files to unwanted directories. Depending on web server configuration and available system libraries, malicious PHP files can then be executed through a web server request. Version 10.0.10 fixes this issue. As a workaround, remove write access on `/ajax` and `/front` files to the web server.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-42802", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nGlpi-project\u00bbGlpiVersions  from including (>=) 10.0.7andbefore (<) 10.0.10cpe:2.3:a:glpi-project:glpi:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-08  0.11%  0.17%  +0.06 \n 2  2024-10-02  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-12-04  0.12%  0.09%  -0.03 \n 4  2023-11-10  0.04%  0.12%  +0.08 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi/security/advisories/GHSA-rrh2-x4ch-pq3m", "ref_desc": "Unallowed PHP script execution \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 glpi-project/glpi \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi/releases/tag/10.0.10", "ref_desc": "Release 10.0.10 \u00b7 glpi-project/glpi \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
