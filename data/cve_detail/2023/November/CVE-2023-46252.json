{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-46252", "Description": "Squidex is an open source headless CMS and content management hub. Affected versions are missing origin verification in a postMessage handler which introduces a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The editor-sdk.js file defines three different class-like functions, which employ a global message event listener: SquidexSidebar, SquidexWidget, and SquidexFormField. The registered event listener takes some action based on the type of the received message. For example, when the SquidexFormField receives a message with the type valueChanged, the value property is updated. The SquidexFormField class is for example used in the editor-editorjs.html file, which can be accessed via the public wwwroot folder. It uses the onValueChanged method to register a callback function, which passes the value provided from the message event to the editor.render. Passing an attacker-controlled value to this function introduces a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46252", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nSquidex.io\u00bbSquidex\u00bbVersion:7.8.2cpe:2.3:a:squidex.io:squidex:7.8.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 31 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-13  0.05%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-07  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-11-16  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Squidex/squidex/security/advisories/GHSA-7q4f-fprr-5jw8", "ref_desc": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via postMessage Handler \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Squidex/squidex \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
