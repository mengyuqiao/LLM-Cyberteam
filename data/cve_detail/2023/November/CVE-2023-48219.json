{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-48219", "Description": "TinyMCE is an open source rich text editor. A mutation cross-site scripting (mXSS) vulnerability was discovered in TinyMCE\u2019s core undo/redo functionality and other APIs and plugins. Text nodes within specific parents are not escaped upon serialization according to the HTML standard. If such text nodes contain a special character reserved as an internal marker, they can be combined with other HTML patterns to form malicious snippets. These snippets pass the initial sanitisation layer when the content is parsed into the editor body, but can trigger XSS when the special internal marker is removed from the content and re-parsed. his vulnerability has been patched in TinyMCE versions 6.7.3 and 5.10.9. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-48219", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nTiny\u00bbTinymceVersions  before (<) 5.10.9cpe:2.3:a:tiny:tinymce:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTiny\u00bbTinymceVersions  from including (>=) 6.0.0andbefore (<) 6.7.3cpe:2.3:a:tiny:tinymce:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 32 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-21  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-15  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-11-23  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://tiny.cloud/docs/release-notes/release-notes5109/", "ref_desc": "TinyMCE 5.10.9 | Docs | TinyMCERelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce/security/advisories/GHSA-v626-r774-j7f8", "ref_desc": "Special characters in unescaped text nodes can trigger mXSS when using TinyMCE undo/redo, getContentAPI, resetContentAPI, and Autosave plugin \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tinymce/tinymce \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/6/6.7.3-release-notes/", "ref_desc": "TinyMCE 6.7.3 | TinyMCE DocumentationRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
