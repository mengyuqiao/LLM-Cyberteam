{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-47111", "Description": "ZITADEL provides identity infrastructure. ZITADEL provides administrators the possibility to define a `Lockout Policy` with a maximum amount of failed password check attempts. On every failed password check, the amount of failed checks is compared against the configured maximum. Exceeding the limit, will lock the user and prevent further authentication. In the affected implementation it was possible for an attacker to start multiple parallel password checks, giving him the possibility to try out more combinations than configured in the `Lockout Policy`. This vulnerability has been patched in versions 2.40.5 and 2.38.3.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-47111", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nZitadel\u00bbZitadelVersions  from including (>=) 2.39.0andbefore (<) 2.40.5cpe:2.3:a:zitadel:zitadel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nZitadel\u00bbZitadelVersions  before (<) 2.38.3cpe:2.3:a:zitadel:zitadel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-14  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-10-08  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-11-17  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-362 Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/362/Concurrent-Execution-using-Shared-Resource-with-Improper-Syn.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.40.5", "ref_desc": "Release v2.40.5 \u00b7 zitadel/zitadel \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.38.3", "ref_desc": "Release v2.38.3 \u00b7 zitadel/zitadel \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/security/advisories/GHSA-7h8m-vrxx-vr4m", "ref_desc": "Race condition in lockout policy execution \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 zitadel/zitadel \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/commit/22e2d5599918864877e054ebe82fb834a5aa1077", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-7h8m-vrxx-vr4m \u00b7 zitadel/zitadel@22e2d55 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
