{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-46724", "Description": "Squid is a caching proxy for the Web. Due to an Improper Validation of Specified Index bug, Squid versions 3.3.0.1 through 5.9 and 6.0 prior to 6.4 compiled using `--with-openssl` are vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack against SSL Certificate validation. This problem allows a remote server to perform Denial of Service against Squid Proxy by initiating a TLS Handshake with a specially crafted SSL Certificate in a server certificate chain. This attack is limited to HTTPS and SSL-Bump. This bug is fixed in Squid version 6.4. In addition, patches addressing this problem for the stable releases can be found in Squid's patch archives. Those who you use a prepackaged version of Squid should refer to the package vendor for availability information on updated packages.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46724", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nSquid-cache\u00bbSquidVersions  from including (>=) 3.3.0.1andbefore (<) 6.4cpe:2.3:a:squid-cache:squid:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.89% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 83 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-03  0.75%  0.89%  +0.14 \n 2  2024-11-07  0.51%  0.75%  +0.24 \n 3  2024-10-13  0.54%  0.51%  -0.03 \n 4  2024-10-01  0.61%  0.54%  -0.07 \n 5  2023-12-29  0.37%  0.61%  +0.24 \n 6  2023-11-10  0.05%  0.37%  +0.33 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-129 Improper Validation of Array Index", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/129/Improper-Validation-of-Array-Index.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-786 Access of Memory Location Before Start of Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/786/Access-of-Memory-Location-Before-Start-of-Buffer.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-823 Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/823/Use-of-Out-of-range-Pointer-Offset.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1285 Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1285/Improper-Validation-of-Specified-Index-Position-or-Offset-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231208-0001/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-46724 Squid Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product Security", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v6/SQUID-2023_4.patch", "ref_desc": "404 Not FoundMailing List;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MEV66D3PAAY6K7TWDT3WZBLCPLASFJDC/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 38 Update: squid-6.6-1.fc38 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/FjM_ivaLWkQliv1_2UA4s5WeYZE.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v5/SQUID-2023_4.patch", "ref_desc": "404 Not FoundMailing List;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/A5QASTMCUSUEW3UOMKHZJB3FTONWSRXS/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 39 Update: squid-6.6-1.fc39 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/MGLW25pXXP02s4oZPRGw5kGuk2M.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/commit/b70f864940225dfe69f9f653f948e787f99c3810", "ref_desc": "Fix validation of certificates with CN=* (#1523) \u00b7 squid-cache/squid@b70f864 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/security/advisories/GHSA-73m6-jm96-c6r3", "ref_desc": "SQUID-2023:4 Denial of Service in SSL Certificate validation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 squid-cache/squid \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
