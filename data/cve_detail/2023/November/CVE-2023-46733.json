{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-46733", "Description": "Symfony is a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set of reusable PHP components. Starting in versions 5.4.21 and 6.2.7 and prior to versions 5.4.31 and 6.3.8, `SessionStrategyListener` does not migrate the session after every successful login. It does so only in case the logged in user changes by means of checking the user identifier. In some use cases, the user identifier doesn't change between the verification phase and the successful login, while the token itself changes from one type (partially-authenticated) to another (fully-authenticated). When this happens, the session id should be regenerated to prevent possible session fixations, which is not the case at the moment. As of versions 5.4.31 and 6.3.8, Symfony now checks the type of the token in addition to the user identifier before deciding whether the session id should be regenerated.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46733", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSensiolabs\u00bbSymfonyVersions  from including (>=) 5.4.21andbefore (<) 5.4.31cpe:2.3:a:sensiolabs:symfony:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSensiolabs\u00bbSymfonyVersions  from including (>=) 6.2.7andbefore (<) 6.3.8cpe:2.3:a:sensiolabs:symfony:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-16  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-10  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-11-17  0.05%  0.10%  +0.06 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-384 Session Fixation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/384/Session-Fixation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/dc356499d5ceb86f7cf2b4c7f032eca97061ed74", "ref_desc": "[Security] Fix possible session fixation when only the *token* changes \u00b7 symfony/symfony@dc35649 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/symfony/symfony/security/advisories/GHSA-m2wj-r6g3-fxfx", "ref_desc": "Possible session fixation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 symfony/symfony \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/7467bd7e3f888b333102bc664b5e02ef1e7f88b9", "ref_desc": "security #cve-2023-46733 [Security] Fix possible session fixation whe\u2026 \u00b7 symfony/symfony@7467bd7 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
