{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-48705", "Description": "Nautobot is a Network Source of Truth and Network Automation Platform built as a web application All users of Nautobot versions earlier than 1.6.6 or 2.0.5 are potentially affected by a cross-site scripting vulnerability. Due to incorrect usage of Django's `mark_safe()` API when rendering certain types of user-authored content; including custom links, job buttons, and computed fields; it is possible that users with permission to create or edit these types of content could craft a malicious payload (such as JavaScript code) that would be executed when rendering pages containing this content. The maintainers have fixed the incorrect uses of `mark_safe()` (generally by replacing them with appropriate use of `format_html()` instead) to prevent such malicious data from being executed. Users on Nautobot 1.6.x LTM should upgrade to v1.6.6 and users on Nautobot 2.0.x should upgrade to v2.0.5. Appropriate object permissions can and should be applied to restrict which users are permitted to create or edit the aforementioned types of user-authored content. Other than that, there is no direct workaround available.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-48705", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nNetworktocode\u00bbNautobotVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.0.5cpe:2.3:a:networktocode:nautobot:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNetworktocode\u00bbNautobotVersions  before (<) 1.6.6cpe:2.3:a:networktocode:nautobot:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-28  0.13%  0.12%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-10-22  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-11-29  0.04%  0.11%  +0.07 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/commit/362850f5a94689a4c75e3188bf6de826c3b012b2", "ref_desc": "[1.6] Fix unsafe `mark_safe` use in various features (#4833) \u00b7 nautobot/nautobot@362850f \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/utils/#django.utils.safestring.mark_safe", "ref_desc": "Django Utils | Django documentation | DjangoTechnical Description", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/4832", "ref_desc": "[2.0] Fix unsafe `mark_safe` use in various features by glennmatthews \u00b7 Pull Request #4832 \u00b7 nautobot/nautobot \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/4833", "ref_desc": "[1.6] Fix unsafe `mark_safe` use in various features by glennmatthews \u00b7 Pull Request #4833 \u00b7 nautobot/nautobot \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-cf9f-wmhp-v4pr", "ref_desc": "XSS potential in custom links, job buttons, and computed fields \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nautobot/nautobot \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/utils/#django.utils.html.format_html", "ref_desc": "Django Utils | Django documentation | DjangoTechnical Description", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/commit/54abe23331b6c3d0d82bf1b028c679b1d200920d", "ref_desc": "[2.0] Fix unsafe `mark_safe` use in various features (#4832) \u00b7 nautobot/nautobot@54abe23 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
