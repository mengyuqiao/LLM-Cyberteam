{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-46251", "Description": "MyBB is a free and open source forum software. Custom MyCode (BBCode) for the visual editor (_SCEditor_) doesn't escape input properly when rendering HTML, resulting in a DOM-based XSS vulnerability. This weakness can be exploited by pointing a victim to a page where the visual editor is active (e.g. as a post or Private Message) and operates on a maliciously crafted MyCode message. This may occur on pages where message content is pre-filled using a GET/POST parameter, or on reply pages where a previously saved malicious message is quoted. The impact is be mitigated when: 1. the visual editor is disabled globally (_Admin CP \u2192 Configuration \u2192 Settings \u2192 Clickable Smilies and BB Code: [Clickable MyCode Editor](https://github.com/mybb/mybb/blob/mybb_1836/install/resources/settings.xml#L2087-L2094)_ is set to _Off_), or 2. the visual editor is disabled for individual user accounts (_User CP \u2192 Your Profile \u2192 Edit Options_: _Show the MyCode formatting options on the posting pages_ checkbox is not checked). MyBB 1.8.37 resolves this issue with the commit `6dcaf0b4d`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate the impact without upgrading MyBB by changing the following setting (_Admin CP \u2192 Configuration \u2192 Settings_):\n- _Clickable Smilies and BB Code \u2192 [Clickable MyCode Editor](https://github.com/mybb/mybb/blob/mybb_1836/install/resources/settings.xml#L2087-L2094)_: _Off_. Similarly, individual MyBB forum users are able to disable the visual editor by diabling the account option (_User CP \u2192 Your Profile \u2192 Edit Options_) _Show the MyCode formatting options on the posting pages_.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46251", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nMybb\u00bbMybbVersions  before (<) 1.8.37cpe:2.3:a:mybb:mybb:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-12  0.06%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-10-06  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-11-15  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/mybb/mybb/commit/6dcaf0b4db6254f1833fe8dae295d9ddc2219276", "ref_desc": "Fix Visual editor size code persistent XSS \u00b7 mybb/mybb@6dcaf0b \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mybb/mybb/security/advisories/GHSA-wj33-q7vj-9fr8", "ref_desc": "Visual editor persistent XSS \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 mybb/mybb \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://mybb.com/versions/1.8.37/", "ref_desc": "Version 1.8.37 - MyBBRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
