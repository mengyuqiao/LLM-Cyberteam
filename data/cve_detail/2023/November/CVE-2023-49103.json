{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-49103", "Description": "An issue was discovered in ownCloud owncloud/graphapi 0.2.x before 0.2.1 and 0.3.x before 0.3.1. The graphapi app relies on a third-party GetPhpInfo.php library that provides a URL. When this URL is accessed, it reveals the configuration details of the PHP environment (phpinfo). This information includes all the environment variables of the webserver. In containerized deployments, these environment variables may include sensitive data such as the ownCloud admin password, mail server credentials, and license key. Simply disabling the graphapi app does not eliminate the vulnerability. Additionally, phpinfo exposes various other potentially sensitive configuration details that could be exploited by an attacker to gather information about the system. Therefore, even if ownCloud is not running in a containerized environment, this vulnerability should still be a cause for concern. Note that Docker containers from before February 2023 are not vulnerable to the credential disclosure.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-49103", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOwncloud\u00bbGraph Api\u00bbVersion:0.2.0cpe:2.3:a:owncloud:graph_api:0.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOwncloud\u00bbGraph Api\u00bbVersion:0.3.0cpe:2.3:a:owncloud:graph_api:0.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "94.83% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 99 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-27  95.11%  94.83%  -0.29 \n 2  2024-11-16  94.79%  95.11%  +0.32 \n 3  2024-11-02  94.93%  94.79%  -0.14 \n 4  2024-10-21  94.76%  94.93%  +0.17 \n 5  2024-10-10  94.97%  94.76%  -0.21 \n 6  2024-09-05  96.47%  94.97%  -1.50 \n 7  2024-09-04  96.40%  96.47%  +0.07 \n 8  2024-08-24  96.21%  96.40%  +0.19 \n 9  2024-08-02  95.31%  96.21%  +0.90 \n 10  2024-07-09  93.89%  95.31%  +1.42 \n 11  2024-06-29  94.12%  93.89%  -0.23 \n 12  2024-06-27  86.00%  94.12%  +8.13 \n 13  2024-06-05  86.74%  86.00%  -0.74 \n 14  2024-05-03  90.17%  86.74%  -3.43 \n 15  2024-04-25  86.98%  90.17%  +3.19 \n 16  2024-04-01  89.25%  86.98%  -2.27 \n 17  2024-03-07  88.83%  89.25%  +0.42 \n 18  2024-02-07  44.99%  88.83%  +43.85 \n 19  2024-01-26  51.75%  44.99%  -6.77 \n 20  2023-12-06  3.70%  51.75%  +48.05 \n 21  2023-12-05  16.39%  3.70%  -12.69 \n 22  2023-12-02  10.89%  16.39%  +5.50 \n 23  2023-12-01  0.92%  10.89%  +9.98 \n 24  2023-11-24  0.04%  0.92%  +0.87 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://owncloud.com/security-advisories/disclosure-of-sensitive-credentials-and-configuration-in-containerized-deployments/", "ref_desc": "Disclosure of sensitive credentials and configuration in containerized deployments - ownCloudVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/-iiqdrKCUE9Ng1MTu7daK_sh_Og.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://owncloud.org/security", "ref_desc": "ownCloud security policies and informationProductCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/2t9XLDXFL-G-IXzWWuXnjKOHvkw.html"}]}
