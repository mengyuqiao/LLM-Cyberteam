{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-49092", "Description": "RustCrypto/RSA is a portable RSA implementation in pure Rust. Due to a non-constant-time implementation, information about the private key is leaked through timing information which is observable over the network. An attacker may be able to use that information to recover the key. There is currently no fix available. As a workaround, avoid using the RSA crate in settings where attackers are able to observe timing information, e.g. local use on a non-compromised computer.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-49092", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nRustcrypto\u00bbRSA\u00bbForRustcpe:2.3:a:rustcrypto:rsa:*:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-28  0.09%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-12-07  0.04%  0.09%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-203 Observable Discrepancy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/203/Observable-Discrepancy.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-385 Covert Timing Channel", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/385/Covert-Timing-Channel.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/RustCrypto/RSA/issues/19#issuecomment-1822995643", "ref_desc": "modpow implementation is not constant-time \u00b7 Issue #19 \u00b7 RustCrypto/RSA \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/RustCrypto/RSA/security/advisories/GHSA-c38w-74pg-36hr", "ref_desc": "Marvin Attack: potential key recovery through timing sidechannels \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 RustCrypto/RSA \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
