{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-48230", "Description": "Cap'n Proto is a data interchange format and capability-based RPC system. In versions 1.0 and 1.0.1, when using the KJ HTTP library with WebSocket compression enabled, a buffer underrun can be caused by a remote peer. The underrun always writes a constant value that is not attacker-controlled, likely resulting in a crash, enabling a remote denial-of-service attack. Most Cap'n Proto and KJ users are unlikely to have this functionality enabled and so unlikely to be affected. Maintainers suspect only the Cloudflare Workers Runtime is affected.\n\nIf KJ HTTP is used with WebSocket compression enabled, a malicious peer may be able to cause a buffer underrun on a heap-allocated buffer. KJ HTTP is an optional library bundled with Cap'n Proto, but is not directly used by Cap'n Proto. WebSocket compression is disabled by default. It must be enabled via a setting passed to the KJ HTTP library via `HttpClientSettings` or `HttpServerSettings`. The bytes written out-of-bounds are always a specific constant 4-byte string `{ 0x00, 0x00, 0xFF, 0xFF }`. Because this string is not controlled by the attacker, maintainers believe it is unlikely that remote code execution is possible. However, it cannot be ruled out. This functionality first appeared in Cap'n Proto 1.0. Previous versions are not affected.\n\nThis issue is fixed in Cap'n Proto 1.0.1.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-48230", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption;Execute code;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCapnproto\u00bbCapnproto\u00bbVersion:1.0.0cpe:2.3:a:capnproto:capnproto:1.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCapnproto\u00bbCapnproto\u00bbVersion:1.0.1cpe:2.3:a:capnproto:capnproto:1.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.41% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 87 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-27  0.73%  1.41%  +0.69 \n 2  2024-11-16  0.57%  0.73%  +0.16 \n 3  2024-10-21  0.51%  0.57%  +0.06 \n 4  2023-11-29  0.06%  0.51%  +0.44 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-124 Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/124/Buffer-Underwrite-Buffer-Underflow-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto/security/advisories/GHSA-r89h-f468-62w3", "ref_desc": "WebSocket message can cause crash \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 capnproto/capnproto \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto/commit/75c5c1499aa6e7690b741204ff9af91cce526c59", "ref_desc": "Fix inconsistent decision about whether a WebSocket message is compre\u2026 \u00b7 capnproto/capnproto@75c5c14 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto/commit/e7f22da9c01286a2b0e1e5fbdf3ec9ab3aa128ff", "ref_desc": "Fix inconsistent decision about whether a WebSocket message is compre\u2026 \u00b7 capnproto/capnproto@e7f22da \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
