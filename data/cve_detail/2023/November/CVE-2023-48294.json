{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-48294", "Description": "LibreNMS is an auto-discovering PHP/MySQL/SNMP based network monitoring which includes support for a wide range of network hardware and operating systems. In affected versions of LibreNMS when a user accesses their device dashboard, one request is sent to `graph.php` to access graphs generated on the particular Device. This request can be accessed by a low privilege user and they can enumerate devices on librenms with their id or hostname. Leveraging this vulnerability a low privilege user can see all devices registered by admin users. This vulnerability has been addressed in commit `489978a923` which has been included in release version 23.11.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-48294", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nLibrenms\u00bbLibrenmsVersions  before (<) 23.11.0cpe:2.3:a:librenms:librenms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 30 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-23  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-17  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-11-30  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/librenms/librenms/blob/fa93034edd40c130c2ff00667ca2498d84be6e69/html/graph.php#L19C1-L25C2", "ref_desc": "librenms/html/graph.php at fa93034edd40c130c2ff00667ca2498d84be6e69 \u00b7 librenms/librenms \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/librenms/librenms/commit/489978a923ed52aa243d3419889ca298a8a6a7cf", "ref_desc": "Fix graphs device check before auth (#15551) \u00b7 librenms/librenms@489978a \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/librenms/librenms/security/advisories/GHSA-fpq5-4vwm-78x4", "ref_desc": "Broken Access control on Graphs Feature \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 librenms/librenms \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
