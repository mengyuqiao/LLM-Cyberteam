{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-46732", "Description": "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. XWiki is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting (RXSS) via the `rev` parameter that is used in the content of the content menu without escaping. If an attacker can convince a user to visit a link with a crafted parameter, this allows the attacker to execute arbitrary actions in the name of the user, including remote code (Groovy) execution in the case of a user with programming right, compromising the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki installation. This has been patched in XWiki 15.6 RC1, 15.5.1 and 14.10.14. The patch in commit `04e325d57` can be manually applied without upgrading (or restarting) the instance. Users are advised to upgrade or to manually apply the patch. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46732", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  from including (>=) 15.0andbefore (<) 15.5.1cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  from including (>=) 9.7andbefore (<) 14.10.14cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 85 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-12  2.32%  1.09%  -1.23 \n 2  2024-11-01  2.71%  2.32%  -0.39 \n 3  2024-10-18  1.93%  2.71%  +0.78 \n 4  2024-10-06  1.71%  1.93%  +0.22 \n 5  2024-09-25  2.41%  1.71%  -0.70 \n 6  2024-09-12  0.84%  2.41%  +1.57 \n 7  2024-08-09  0.82%  0.84%  +0.02 \n 8  2024-07-27  0.69%  0.82%  +0.13 \n 9  2024-07-05  0.49%  0.69%  +0.21 \n 10  2024-06-21  0.09%  0.49%  +0.40 \n 11  2024-02-21  0.13%  0.09%  -0.04 \n 12  2023-11-15  0.05%  0.13%  +0.08 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/04e325d57d4bcb6ab79bddcafbb19032474c2a55", "ref_desc": "XWIKI-21095: Improve revision handling in code viewer menu item \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform@04e325d \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-21095", "ref_desc": "[XWIKI-21095] RXSS through revision parameter in content menu - XWiki.org JIRAIssue Tracking;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-j9rc-w3wv-fv62", "ref_desc": "RXSS through revision parameter in content menu \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
