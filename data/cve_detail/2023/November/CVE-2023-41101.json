{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-41101", "Description": "An issue was discovered in the captive portal in OpenNDS before version 10.1.3. get_query in http_microhttpd.c does not validate the length of the query string of GET requests. This leads to a stack-based buffer overflow in versions 9.x and earlier, and to a heap-based buffer overflow in versions 10.x and later. Attackers may exploit the issue to crash OpenNDS (Denial-of-Service condition) or to inject and execute arbitrary bytecode (Remote Code Execution). Affected OpenNDS before version 10.1.3 fixed in OpenWrt master and OpenWrt 23.05 on 23. November by updating OpenNDS to version 10.2.0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-41101", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Execute code;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nOpennds\u00bbOpenndsVersions  from including (>=) 9.0.0andbefore (<) 10.1.3cpe:2.3:a:opennds:opennds:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.97% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 84 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-23  0.52%  0.97%  +0.45 \n 2  2024-11-12  0.44%  0.52%  +0.08 \n 3  2024-10-17  0.38%  0.44%  +0.06 \n 4  2024-06-21  0.25%  0.38%  +0.13 \n 5  2023-11-25  0.11%  0.25%  +0.14 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/openNDS/openNDS/releases/tag/v10.1.3", "ref_desc": "Release OpenNDS v10.1.3 release \u00b7 openNDS/openNDS \u00b7 GitHubRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/_RYzeTJnJTx4FdejnXYNcl0ugqQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/openNDS/openNDS/commit/c294cf30e0a2512062c66e6becb674557b4aed8d", "ref_desc": "Fix - Buffer overflow causing segfault - CVE-2023-41101 \u00b7 openNDS/openNDS@c294cf3 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://source.sierrawireless.com/resources/security-bulletins/sierra-wireless-technical-bulletin---swi-psa-2023-006-v4/#sthash.2vJg3d85.rwx82g1C.dpbs", "ref_desc": "CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/n2zb5AxDsRwxfc1ykZz4DivGLAQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/openwrt/routing/commit/88c98c910acccab694b3afb6d36d70ca429118a6", "ref_desc": "opennds: update to version 10.1.3 \u00b7 openwrt/routing@88c98c9 \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
