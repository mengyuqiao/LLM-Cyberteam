{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-49090", "Description": "CarrierWave is a solution for file uploads for Rails, Sinatra and other Ruby web frameworks. CarrierWave has a Content-Type allowlist bypass vulnerability, possibly leading to XSS. The validation in `allowlisted_content_type?` determines Content-Type permissions by performing a partial match. If the `content_type` argument of `allowlisted_content_type?` is passed a value crafted by the attacker, Content-Types not included in the `content_type_allowlist` will be allowed. This issue has been patched in versions 2.2.5 and 3.0.5.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-49090", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nCarrierwave Project\u00bbCarrierwave\u00bbForRubyVersions  before (<) 2.2.5cpe:2.3:a:carrierwave_project:carrierwave:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions\nCarrierwave Project\u00bbCarrierwave\u00bbForRubyVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andbefore (<) 3.0.5cpe:2.3:a:carrierwave_project:carrierwave:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 25 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-29  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-12-06  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/commit/39b282db5c1303899b3d3381ce8a837840f983b5", "ref_desc": "Fix Content-Type allowlist bypass vulnerability \u00b7 carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave@39b282d \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/commit/863d425c76eba12c3294227b39018f6b2dccbbf3", "ref_desc": "Fix Content-Type allowlist bypass vulnerability \u00b7 carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave@863d425 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/security/advisories/GHSA-gxhx-g4fq-49hj", "ref_desc": "Content-Type allowlist bypass vulnerability, possibly leading to XSS \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
