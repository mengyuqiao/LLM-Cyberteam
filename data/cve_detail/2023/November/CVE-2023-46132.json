{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-46132", "Description": "Hyperledger Fabric is an open source permissioned distributed ledger framework. Combining two molecules to one another, called \"cross-linking\" results in a molecule with a chemical formula that is composed of all atoms of the original two molecules. In Fabric, one can take a block of transactions and cross-link the transactions in a way that alters the way the peers parse the transactions. If a first peer receives a block B and a second peer receives a block identical to B but with the transactions being cross-linked, the second peer will parse transactions in a different way and thus its world state will deviate from the first peer. Orderers or peers cannot detect that a block has its transactions cross-linked, because there is a vulnerability in the way Fabric hashes the transactions of blocks. It simply and naively concatenates them, which is insecure and lets an adversary craft a \"cross-linked block\" (block with cross-linked transactions) which alters the way peers process transactions. For example, it is possible to select a transaction and manipulate a peer to completely avoid processing it, without changing the computed hash of the block. Additional validations have been added in v2.2.14 and v2.5.5 to detect potential cross-linking issues before processing blocks. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46132", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nHyperledger\u00bbFabricVersions  from including (>=) 2.3.0andbefore (<) 2.5.5cpe:2.3:a:hyperledger:fabric:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nHyperledger\u00bbFabricVersions  from including (>=) 1.0.0andbefore (<) 2.2.14cpe:2.3:a:hyperledger:fabric:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 25 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-20  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-14  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-11-23  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-362 Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/362/Concurrent-Execution-using-Shared-Resource-with-Improper-Syn.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/security/advisories/GHSA-v9w2-543f-h69m", "ref_desc": "Crosslinking transaction attack \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 hyperledger/fabric \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Mitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
