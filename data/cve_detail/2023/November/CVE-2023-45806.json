{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-45806", "Description": "Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. Prior to version 3.1.3 of the `stable` branch and version 3.2.0.beta3 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, if a user has been quoted and uses a `|` in their full name, they might be able to trigger a bug that generates a lot of duplicate content in all the posts they've been quoted by updating their full name again. Version 3.1.3 of the `stable` branch and version 3.2.0.beta3 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches contain a patch for this issue. No known workaround exists, although one can stop the \"bleeding\" by ensuring users only use alphanumeric characters in their full name field.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45806", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bb     StableEditionVersions  before (<) 3.1.3cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:*:*:*:*:stable:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bb     BetaEditionVersions  before (<) 3.2.0cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:*:*:*:*:beta:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bbVersion:3.2.0UpdateBeta1   BetaEditioncpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:3.2.0:beta1:*:*:beta:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bbVersion:3.2.0UpdateBeta2   BetaEditioncpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:3.2.0:beta2:*:*:beta:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 36 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-16  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-10-10  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-11-18  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1333 Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1333/Inefficient-Regular-Expression-Complexity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/security/advisories/GHSA-hcgf-hg2g-mw78", "ref_desc": "DoS via Regexp Injection in Full Name \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 discourse/discourse \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commit/7d484864fe91ff79c478f57e7ddb1235d701921e", "ref_desc": "SECURITY: escape display names \u00b7 discourse/discourse@7d48486 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commit/2ec25105179199cf80912bf011c18b8b870e1863", "ref_desc": "SECURITY: escape display names \u00b7 discourse/discourse@2ec2510 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
