{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-46244", "Description": "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. In affected versions it's possible for a user to write a script in which any velocity content is executed with the right of any other document content author. Since this API require programming right and the user does not have it, the expected result is `$doc.document.authors.contentAuthor` (not executed script), unfortunately with the security vulnerability it is possible for the attacker to get `XWiki.superadmin` which shows that the title was executed with the right of the unmodified document. This has been patched in XWiki versions 14.10.7 and 15.2RC1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46244", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  from including (>=) 3.3andbefore (<) 14.10.7cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  from including (>=) 15.0andbefore (<) 15.2cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbXwiki\u00bbVersion:3.2UpdateMilestone3cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:3.2:milestone3:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-13  0.09%  0.13%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-10-07  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-11-15  0.05%  0.08%  +0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-rmxw-c48h-2vf5", "ref_desc": "Privilege escalation from script right to programming right through title displayer \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20624", "ref_desc": "[XWIKI-20624] Privilege escalation from script right to programming right through title displayer - XWiki.org JIRAIssue Tracking;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/11a9170dfe63e59f4066db67f84dbfce4ed619c6", "ref_desc": "XWIKI-20624: Improve title display for modified documents \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform@11a9170 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20625", "ref_desc": "[XWIKI-20625] Velocity execution without script right through tree macro - XWiki.org JIRAIssue Tracking;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/WBZGTuLThOVw0nCNUr_ZI393V5k.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/41d7dca2d30084966ca6a7ee537f39ee8354a7e3", "ref_desc": "XWIKI-20625: Improve document title display in the document tree \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform@41d7dca \u00b7 GitHubPatchCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/X-tfFk89Yhq6urxWjmgo5JNX3w0.html"}]}
