{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-48218", "Description": "The Strapi Protected Populate Plugin protects `get` endpoints from revealing too much information. Prior to version 1.3.4, users were able to bypass the field level security. Users who tried to populate something that they didn't have access to could populate those fields anyway. This issue has been patched in version 1.3.4. There are no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-48218", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nStrapi\u00bbProtected PopulateVersions  before (<) 1.3.4cpe:2.3:a:strapi:protected_populate:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 34 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-26  0.06%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-10-20  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-11-30  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/strapi-community/strapi-plugin-protected-populate/security/advisories/GHSA-6h67-934r-82g7", "ref_desc": "Leaking fields if the request fields where empty or only fields selected where not populatable \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 strapi-community/strapi-plugin-protected-populate \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/strapi-community/strapi-plugin-protected-populate/commit/05441066d64e09dd55937d9f089962e9ebe2fb39", "ref_desc": "fix fields always populating ID \u00b7 strapi-community/strapi-plugin-protected-populate@0544106 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/strapi-community/strapi-plugin-protected-populate/releases/tag/v1.3.4", "ref_desc": "Release v1.3.4 \u00b7 strapi-community/strapi-plugin-protected-populate \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
