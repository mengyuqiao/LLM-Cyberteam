{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-48199", "Description": "HTML Injection vulnerability in the 'manageApiKeys' component in Grocy <= 4.0.3 allows attackers to inject arbitrary HTML content without script execution. This occurs when user-supplied data is not appropriately sanitized, enabling the injection of HTML tags through parameter values. The attacker can then manipulate page content in the QR code detail popup, often coupled with social engineering tactics, exploiting both the trust of users and the application's lack of proper input handling.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-48199", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGrocy Project\u00bbGrocy\u00bbVersion:4.0.3cpe:2.3:a:grocy_project:grocy:4.0.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-11-21  0.06%  0.04%  -0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://grocy.info", "ref_desc": "Grocy - ERP beyond your fridgeProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/grocy/grocy", "ref_desc": "GitHub - grocy/grocy: ERP beyond your fridge - Grocy is a web-based self-hosted groceries & household management solution for your homeProductCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/IKs0xwpHaEO9sp9rb1UKeDr_tMA.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://nitipoom-jar.github.io/CVE-2023-48199/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-48199Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
