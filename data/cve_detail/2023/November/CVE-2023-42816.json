{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-42816", "Description": "Kyverno is a policy engine designed for Kubernetes. A security vulnerability was found in Kyverno where an attacker could cause denial of service of Kyverno. The vulnerability was in Kyvernos Notary verifier. An attacker would need control over the registry from which Kyverno would fetch signatures. With such a position, the attacker could return a malicious response to Kyverno, when Kyverno would send a request to the registry. The malicious response would cause denial of service of Kyverno, such that other users' admission requests would be blocked from being processed. This is a vulnerability in a new component released in v1.11.0. The only users affected by this are those that have been building Kyverno from source at the main branch which is not encouraged. Users consuming official Kyverno releases are not affected. There are no known cases of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-42816", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nNirmata\u00bbKyverno\u00bbVersion:1.11.0ForGOcpe:2.3:a:nirmata:kyverno:1.11.0:-:*:*:*:go:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-19  0.07%  0.10%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-10-13  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-11-22  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-11-15  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-345 Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/345/Insufficient-Verification-of-Data-Authenticity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/commit/fec2992e3f9fcd6b9c62267522c09b182e7df73b", "ref_desc": "fix: address vulnerability issues in notary implementations (#8428) \u00b7 kyverno/kyverno@fec2992 \u00b7 GitHubPatchCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/0AUVuH18A84QybegvgX7AnqqW6o.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/commit/80d139bb5d1d9d7e907abe851b97dc73821a5be2", "ref_desc": "Added `fetchAttestations` method to notaryV2 implimentation (#6800) \u00b7 kyverno/kyverno@80d139b \u00b7 GitHubPatchCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/e14GINCDARF5y4v_3ciAY3NxUeU.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/security/advisories/GHSA-4mp4-46gq-hv3r", "ref_desc": "Denial of service from malicious signature \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 kyverno/kyverno \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/pull/8428", "ref_desc": "Check payload counts and limits for image verification data returned from registries by vishal-chdhry \u00b7 Pull Request #8428 \u00b7 kyverno/kyverno \u00b7 GitHubPatchCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/yHwSeZfU1AC3H5p0ufVKFAsXJas.html"}]}
