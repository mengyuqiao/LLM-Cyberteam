{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-47625", "Description": "PX4 autopilot is a flight control solution for drones. In affected versions a global buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the CrsfParser_TryParseCrsfPacket function in /src/drivers/rc/crsf_rc/CrsfParser.cpp:298 due to the invalid size check. A malicious user may create an RC packet remotely and that packet goes into the device where the _rcs_buf reads. The global buffer overflow vulnerability will be triggered and the drone can behave unexpectedly. This issue has been addressed in version 1.14.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-47625", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nDronecode\u00bbPx4 Drone Autopilot\u00bbVersion:1.14.0UpdateRC2cpe:2.3:a:dronecode:px4_drone_autopilot:1.14.0:rc2:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 28 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-19  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-13  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-11-21  0.06%  0.04%  -0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/120/Buffer-Copy-without-Checking-Size-of-Input-Classic-Buffer-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/commit/d1fcd39a44e6312582c6ab02b0d5ee2599fb55aa", "ref_desc": "fix crsf_rc: prevent potential buffer overflow for unknown packets \u00b7 PX4/PX4-Autopilot@d1fcd39 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/security/advisories/GHSA-qpw7-65ww-wj82", "ref_desc": "[Bug Report] Vulnerable Bug Found in CrsfParser_TryParseCrsfPacket which can trigger Global Buffer Overflow \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 PX4/PX4-Autopilot \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
