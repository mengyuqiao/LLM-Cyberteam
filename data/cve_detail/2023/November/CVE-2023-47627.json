{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-47627", "Description": "aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python. The HTTP parser in AIOHTTP has numerous problems with header parsing, which could lead to request smuggling. This parser is only used when AIOHTTP_NO_EXTENSIONS is enabled (or not using a prebuilt wheel). These bugs have been addressed in commit `d5c12ba89` which has been included in release version 3.8.6. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for these issues.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-47627", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAiohttp\u00bbAiohttpVersions  before (<) 3.8.6cpe:2.3:a:aiohttp:aiohttp:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-20  0.09%  0.13%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-10-14  0.07%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-12-07  0.05%  0.07%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-11-23  0.05%  0.05%  -0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-444 Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/444/Inconsistent-Interpretation-of-HTTP-Requests-HTTP-Request-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VDKQ6HM3KNDU4OQI476ZWT4O7DMSIT35/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 38 Update: llhttp-9.1.3-1.fc38 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FUSJVQ7OQ55RWL4XAX2F5EZ73N4ZSH6U/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 39 Update: llhttp-9.1.3-1.fc39 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WQYQL6WV535EEKSNH7KRARLLMOW5WXDM/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 39 Update: uxplay-1.66-2.fc39 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/security/advisories/GHSA-gfw2-4jvh-wgfg", "ref_desc": "Problems in HTTP parser (the python one, not llhttp) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 aio-libs/aiohttp \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/commit/d5c12ba890557a575c313bb3017910d7616fce3d", "ref_desc": "[PR #7661/85713a48 backport][3.8] Update Python parser for RFCs 9110/\u2026 \u00b7 aio-libs/aiohttp@d5c12ba \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
