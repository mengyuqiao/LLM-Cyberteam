{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-44398", "Description": "Exiv2 is a C++ library and a command-line utility to read, write, delete and modify Exif, IPTC, XMP and ICC image metadata. An out-of-bounds write was found in Exiv2 version v0.28.0. The vulnerable function, `BmffImage::brotliUncompress`, is new in v0.28.0, so earlier versions of Exiv2 are _not_ affected. The out-of-bounds write is triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata of a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to gain code execution, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. This bug is fixed in version v0.28.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-44398", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nExiv2\u00bbExiv2\u00bbVersion:0.28.0cpe:2.3:a:exiv2:exiv2:0.28.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 57 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-12  0.10%  0.19%  +0.09 \n 2  2024-10-06  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-12-23  0.13%  0.09%  -0.05 \n 4  2023-11-15  0.04%  0.13%  +0.09 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/security/advisories/GHSA-hrw9-ggg3-3r4r", "ref_desc": "Out-of-bounds write in BmffImage::brotliUncompress \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Exiv2/exiv2 \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/commit/e884a0955359107f4031c74a07406df7e99929a5", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-hrw9-ggg3-3r4r \u00b7 Exiv2/exiv2@e884a09 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202312-06", "ref_desc": "Exiv2: Multiple Vulnerabilities (GLSA 202312-06) \u2014 Gentoo securityCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/pWbz1VGAGOJZ_ceLObIg2z0V9Pk.html"}]}
