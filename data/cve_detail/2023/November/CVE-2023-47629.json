{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-47629", "Description": "DataHub is an open-source metadata platform. In affected versions sign-up through an invite link does not properly restrict users from signing up as privileged accounts. If a user is given an email sign-up link they can potentially create an admin account given certain preconditions. If the default datahub user has been removed, then the user can sign up for an account that leverages the default policies giving admin privileges to the datahub user. All DataHub instances prior to the patch that have removed the datahub user, but not the default policies applying to that user are affected. Users are advised to update to version 0.12.1 which addresses the issue. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-47629", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDatahub Project\u00bbDatahubVersions  before (<) 0.12.1cpe:2.3:a:datahub_project:datahub:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-20  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-10-14  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-11-21  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/datahub-project/datahub/security/advisories/GHSA-vj59-23ww-p6c8", "ref_desc": "Privilege escalation through email sign-up \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 datahub-project/datahub \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
