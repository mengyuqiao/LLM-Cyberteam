{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-45283", "Description": "The filepath package does not recognize paths with a \\??\\ prefix as special. On Windows, a path beginning with \\??\\ is a Root Local Device path equivalent to a path beginning with \\\\?\\. Paths with a \\??\\ prefix may be used to access arbitrary locations on the system. For example, the path \\??\\c:\\x is equivalent to the more common path c:\\x. Before fix, Clean could convert a rooted path such as \\a\\..\\??\\b into the root local device path \\??\\b. Clean will now convert this to .\\??\\b. Similarly, Join(\\, ??, b) could convert a seemingly innocent sequence of path elements into the root local device path \\??\\b. Join will now convert this to \\.\\??\\b. In addition, with fix, IsAbs now correctly reports paths beginning with \\??\\ as absolute, and VolumeName correctly reports the \\??\\ prefix as a volume name. UPDATE: Go 1.20.11 and Go 1.21.4 inadvertently changed the definition of the volume name in Windows paths starting with \\?, resulting in filepath.Clean(\\?\\c:) returning \\?\\c: rather than \\?\\c:\\ (among other effects). The previous behavior has been restored.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45283", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nGolang\u00bbGOVersions  from including (>=) 1.21.0-0andbefore (<) 1.21.4cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A\nGolang\u00bbGOVersions  before (<) 1.20.11cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-15  0.11%  0.17%  +0.05 \n 2  2024-10-09  0.10%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-12-15  0.10%  0.10%  0.00 \n 4  2023-12-07  0.06%  0.10%  +0.04 \n 5  2023-11-18  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://go.dev/cl/541175", "ref_desc": "path/filepath: consider \\\\?\\c: as a volume on Windows (541175) \u00b7 Gerrit Code Review", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/4tU8LZfBFkY", "ref_desc": "[security] Go 1.21.4 and Go 1.20.11 are releasedIssue Tracking;Mailing List;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/BqTz7qYHNlxqy3BPOpgJ4f55doo.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://go.dev/issue/63713", "ref_desc": "path/filepath: insecure parsing of Windows paths \u00b7 Issue #63713 \u00b7 golang/go \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/q16Zc_q7AdJDhqplJEHHn4ZvmnU.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://go.dev/cl/540277", "ref_desc": "path/filepath: fix various issues in parsing Windows paths (540277) \u00b7 Gerrit Code ReviewIssue Tracking;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/qwDi1LvWReLhBZcQ7LQehomP0SA.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://groups.google.com/g/golang-dev/c/6ypN5EjibjM/m/KmLVYH_uAgAJ", "ref_desc": "[security] Go 1.21.5 and Go 1.20.12 are releasedCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/T_hw9nE0NSfoeaqHNz3mHzt4Pi8.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/12/05/2", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Security fixes in Go 1.21.5 and Go 1.20.12 releases", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://go.dev/issue/64028", "ref_desc": "path/filepath: Clean removes ending slash for volume on Windows in Go 1.21.4 \u00b7 Issue #64028 \u00b7 golang/go \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-2185", "ref_desc": "GO-2023-2185 - Go PackagesIssue Tracking;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231214-0008/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-45283 Golang Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product Security", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
