{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-48238", "Description": "joaquimserafim/json-web-token is a javascript library use to interact with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) which are a compact URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. Affected versions of the json-web-token library are vulnerable to a JWT algorithm confusion attack. On line 86 of the 'index.js' file, the algorithm to use for verifying the signature of the JWT token is taken from the JWT token, which at that point is still unverified and thus shouldn't be trusted. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to craft a malicious JWT token containing the HS256 algorithm, signed with the public RSA key of the victim application. This attack will only work against this library is the RS256 algorithm is in use, however it is a best practice to use that algorithm.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-48238", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nJoaquimserafim\u00bbJson Web Token\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 3.1.1cpe:2.3:a:joaquimserafim:json_web_token:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 32 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-23  0.05%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-17  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-11-30  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-345 Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/345/Insufficient-Verification-of-Data-Authenticity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/joaquimserafim/json-web-token/security/advisories/GHSA-4xw9-cx39-r355", "ref_desc": "JWT Algorithm Confusion \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 joaquimserafim/json-web-token \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
