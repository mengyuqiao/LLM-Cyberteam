{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-47636", "Description": "The Pimcore Admin Classic Bundle provides a Backend UI for Pimcore. Full Path Disclosure (FPD) vulnerabilities enable the attacker to see the path to the webroot/file. e.g.: /home/omg/htdocs/file/. Certain vulnerabilities, such as using the load_file() (within a SQL Injection) query to view the page source, require the attacker to have the full path to the file they wish to view. In the case of pimcore, the fopen() function here doesn't have an error handle when the file doesn't exist on the server so the server response raises the full path \"fopen(/var/www/html/var/tmp/export-{ uniqe id}.csv)\". This issue has been patched in commit `10d178ef771` which has been included in release version 1.2.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-47636", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nPimcore\u00bbAdmin Classic Bundle\u00bbForPimcoreVersions  before (<) 1.2.1cpe:2.3:a:pimcore:admin_classic_bundle:*:*:*:*:*:pimcore:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 35 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-21  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-10-15  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-11-23  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-209 Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/209/Generation-of-Error-Message-Containing-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle/commit/10d178ef771097604a256c1192b098af9ec57a87", "ref_desc": "Grid Export - Catch unable to read file exception (#342) \u00b7 pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle@10d178e \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://huntr.com/bounties/4af4db18-9fd4-43e9-8bc6-c88aaf76839c/", "ref_desc": "Full Path Disclosure (FPD) via re-export document vulnerability found in pimcoreExploit", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle/security/advisories/GHSA-c8hj-w239-5gvf", "ref_desc": "Full Path Disclosure via re-export document \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
