{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-48310", "Description": "TestingPlatform is a testing platform for Internet Security Standards. Prior to version 2.1.1, user input is not filtered correctly. Nmap options are accepted. In this particular case, the option to create log files is accepted in addition to a host name (and even without). A log file is created at the location specified. These files are created as root. If the file exists, the existing file is being rendered useless. This can result in denial of service. Additionally, input for scanning can be any CIDR blocks passed to nmap. An attacker can scan 0.0.0.0/0 or even local networks. Version 2.1.1 contains a patch for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-48310", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nNC3\u00bbTesting PlatformVersions  before (<) 2.1.1cpe:2.3:a:nc3:testing_platform:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 45 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-26  0.07%  0.11%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-10-20  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-11-30  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/NC3-LU/TestingPlatform/releases/tag/v2.1.1", "ref_desc": "Release Testing Platform 2.1.1 \u00b7 NC3-LU/TestingPlatform \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/NC3-LU/TestingPlatform/security/advisories/GHSA-mmpf-rw6c-67mm", "ref_desc": "Input for scanning can be any CIDR blocks passed to nmap \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 NC3-LU/TestingPlatform \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/NC3-LU/TestingPlatform/commit/7b3e7ca869a4845aa7445f874c22c5929315c3a7", "ref_desc": "chg: [security] Added new domain name validator used in the file test\u2026 \u00b7 NC3-LU/TestingPlatform@7b3e7ca \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/NC3-LU/TestingPlatform/security/advisories/GHSA-9fhc-f3mr-w6h6", "ref_desc": "Ability to DoS the testing infrastructure by overwriting files \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 NC3-LU/TestingPlatform \u00b7 GitHubExploit", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
