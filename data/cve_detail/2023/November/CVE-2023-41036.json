{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-41036", "Description": "Macvim is a text editor for MacOS. Prior to version 178, Macvim makes use of an insecure interprocess communication (IPC) mechanism which could lead to a privilege escalation. Distributed objects are a concept introduced by Apple which allow one program to vend an interface to another program. What is not made clear in the documentation is that this service can vend this interface to any other program on the machine. The impact of exploitation is a privilege escalation to root - this is likely to affect anyone who is not careful about the software they download and use MacVim to edit files that would require root privileges. Version 178 contains a fix for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-41036", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nMacvim\u00bbMacvim\u00bbForMacosVersions  before (<) 178cpe:2.3:a:macvim:macvim:*:*:*:*:*:macos:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-11-15  0.05%  0.04%  0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "ttps://github.com/macvim-dev/macvim/blob/d9de087dddadbfd82fcb5dc9734380a2f829bd0a/src/MacVim/MMBackend.h", "ref_desc": "Broken Link", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/macvim-dev/macvim/blob/d9de087dddadbfd82fcb5dc9734380a2f829bd0a/src/MacVim/MMAppController.h#L28", "ref_desc": "macvim/src/MacVim/MMAppController.h at d9de087dddadbfd82fcb5dc9734380a2f829bd0a \u00b7 macvim-dev/macvim \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/macvim-dev/macvim/security/advisories/GHSA-9jgj-jfwg-99fv", "ref_desc": "Insecure Usage of IPC Mechanisms \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 macvim-dev/macvim \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/macvim-dev/macvim/blob/d9de087dddadbfd82fcb5dc9734380a2f829bd0a/src/MacVim/MMBackend.h", "ref_desc": "macvim/src/MacVim/MMBackend.h at d9de087dddadbfd82fcb5dc9734380a2f829bd0a \u00b7 macvim-dev/macvim \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/macvim-dev/macvim/commit/399b43e9e1dbf656a1780e87344f4d3c875e4cda", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-9jgj-jfwg-99fv \u00b7 macvim-dev/macvim@399b43e \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
