{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-47248", "Description": "Deserialization of untrusted data in IPC and Parquet readers in PyArrow versions 0.14.0 to 14.0.0 allows arbitrary code execution. An application is vulnerable if it reads Arrow IPC, Feather or Parquet data from untrusted sources (for example user-supplied input files).\n\nThis vulnerability only affects PyArrow, not other Apache Arrow implementations or bindings.\n\nIt is recommended that users of PyArrow upgrade to 14.0.1. Similarly, it is recommended that downstream libraries upgrade their dependency requirements to PyArrow 14.0.1 or later. PyPI packages are already available, and we hope that conda-forge packages will be available soon.\n\nIf it is not possible to upgrade, we provide a separate package `pyarrow-hotfix` that disables the vulnerability on older PyArrow versions. See  https://pypi.org/project/pyarrow-hotfix/  for instructions.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-47248", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbPyarrowVersions  from including (>=) 0.14.0andup to, including, (<=) 14.0.0cpe:2.3:a:apache:pyarrow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.73% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 81 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-15  0.52%  0.73%  +0.21 \n 2  2024-05-16  0.50%  0.52%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-11-29  0.28%  0.50%  +0.22 \n 4  2023-11-18  0.05%  0.28%  +0.24 \n 5  2023-11-10  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MAGWEAJDWO2ACYATUQCPXLSYY5C3L3XU/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 38 Update: python-geopandas-0.14.1-1.fc38 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://pypi.org/project/pyarrow-hotfix/", "ref_desc": "pyarrow-hotfix \u00b7 PyPIProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/apache/arrow/commit/f14170976372436ec1d03a724d8d3f3925484ecf", "ref_desc": "GH-38607: [Python] Disable PyExtensionType autoload (#38608) \u00b7 apache/arrow@f141709 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MWFYXLVBTBHNKYRXI572RFX7IJDDQGBL/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 37 Update: python-geopandas-0.14.1-1.fc37 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/yhy7tdfjf9hrl9vfrtzo8p2cyjq87v7n", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-47248: PyArrow, PyArrow: Arbitrary code execution when loading a malicious data file-Apache Mail ArchivesMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FR34AIPXVTMB3XPRU5ULV5HHWPMRE33X/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 39 Update: python-geopandas-0.14.1-1.fc39 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
