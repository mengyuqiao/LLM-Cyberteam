{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-45878", "Description": "GibbonEdu Gibbon version 25.0.1 and before allows Arbitrary File Write because rubrics_visualise_saveAjax.phps does not require authentication. The endpoint accepts the img, path, and gibbonPersonID parameters. The img parameter is expected to be a base64 encoded image. If the path parameter is set, the defined path is used as the destination folder, concatenated with the absolute path of the installation directory. The content of the img parameter is base64 decoded and written to the defined file path. This allows creation of PHP files that permit Remote Code Execution (unauthenticated).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45878", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nGibbonedu\u00bbGibbonVersions  up to, including, (<=) 25.0.01cpe:2.3:a:gibbonedu:gibbon:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.92% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 83 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-20  0.56%  0.92%  +0.35 \n 2  2024-10-14  0.50%  0.56%  +0.06 \n 3  2023-11-18  0.05%  0.50%  +0.46 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://herolab.usd.de/security-advisories/usd-2023-0025/", "ref_desc": "usd-2023-0025 - usd HeroLabExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
