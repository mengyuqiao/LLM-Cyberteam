{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-48299", "Description": "TorchServe is a tool for serving and scaling PyTorch models in production. Starting in version 0.1.0 and prior to version 0.9.0, using the model/workflow management API, there is a chance of uploading potentially harmful archives that contain files that are extracted to any location on the filesystem that is within the process permissions. Leveraging this issue could aid third-party actors in hiding harmful code in open-source/public models, which can be downloaded from the internet, and take advantage of machines running Torchserve. The ZipSlip issue in TorchServe has been fixed by validating the paths of files contained within a zip archive before extracting them. TorchServe release 0.9.0 includes fixes to address the ZipSlip vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-48299", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nPytorch\u00bbTorchserveVersions  from including (>=) 0.1.0andbefore (<) 0.9.0cpe:2.3:a:pytorch:torchserve:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-27  0.06%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-10-21  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-11-29  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pytorch/serve/releases/tag/v0.9.0", "ref_desc": "Release TorchServe v0.9.0 Release Notes \u00b7 pytorch/serve \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pytorch/serve/security/advisories/GHSA-m2mj-pr4f-h9jp", "ref_desc": "TorchServe ZipSlip \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pytorch/serve \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/2634", "ref_desc": "fix zip slip by msaroufim \u00b7 Pull Request #2634 \u00b7 pytorch/serve \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pytorch/serve/commit/bfb3d42396727614aef625143b4381e64142f9bb", "ref_desc": "fix zip slip error (#2634) \u00b7 pytorch/serve@bfb3d42 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
