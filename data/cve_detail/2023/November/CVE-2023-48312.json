{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-48312", "Description": "capsule-proxy is a reverse proxy for the capsule operator project. Affected versions are subject to a privilege escalation vulnerability which is based on a missing check if the user is authenticated based on the `TokenReview` result. All the clusters running with the `anonymous-auth` Kubernetes API Server setting disable (set to `false`) are affected since it would be possible to bypass the token review mechanism, interacting with the upper Kubernetes API Server. This privilege escalation cannot be exploited if you're relying only on client certificates (SSL/TLS). This vulnerability has been addressed in version 0.4.6. Users are advised to upgrade.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-48312", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nClastix\u00bbCapsule-proxyVersions  up to, including, (<=) 0.4.5cpe:2.3:a:clastix:capsule-proxy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 45 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-30  0.07%  0.11%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-10-24  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-12-01  0.04%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/projectcapsule/capsule-proxy/security/advisories/GHSA-fpvw-6m5v-hqfp", "ref_desc": "Authentication bypass using an empty token \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 projectcapsule/capsule-proxy \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/projectcapsule/capsule-proxy/commit/472404f7006a4152e4eec76dee07324dd1e6e823", "ref_desc": "fix: fix authentication bypass for capsule-proxy \u00b7 projectcapsule/capsule-proxy@472404f \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
