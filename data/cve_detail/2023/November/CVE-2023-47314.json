{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-47314", "Description": "Headwind MDM Web panel 5.22.1 is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS). The file upload function allows APK and arbitrary files to be uploaded. By exploiting this issue, attackers may upload HTML files and share the download URL pointing to these files with the victims. As the file download function returns the file in inline mode, the victim\u2019s browser will immediately render the content of the HTML file as a web page. As a result, the uploaded client-side code will be evaluated and executed in the victim\u2019s browser, allowing attackers to perform common XSS attacks.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-47314", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nH-mdm\u00bbHeadwind Mdm\u00bbVersion:5.22.1cpe:2.3:a:h-mdm:headwind_mdm:5.22.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 25 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-28  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-22  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-11-30  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://boltonshield.com/en/cve/cve-2023-47314/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-47314 \u2013 Headwind MDM Web panel 5.22.1 \u2013 XSS via Uncontrolled File Upload - BoltonshieldExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
