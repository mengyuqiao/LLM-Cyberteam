{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-48241", "Description": "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in version 6.3-milestone-2 and prior to versions 14.10.15, 15.5.1, and 15.6RC1, the Solr-based search suggestion provider that also duplicates as generic JavaScript API for search results in XWiki exposes the content of all documents of all wikis to anybody who has access to it, by default it is public. This exposes all information stored in the wiki (but not some protected information like password hashes). While there is a right check normally, the right check can be circumvented by explicitly requesting fields from Solr that don't include the data for the right check. This has been fixed in XWiki 15.6RC1, 15.5.1 and 14.10.15 by not listing documents whose rights cannot be checked. No known workarounds are available.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-48241", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  from including (>=) 6.4andbefore (<) 14.10.5cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  from including (>=) 15.0andbefore (<) 15.5.1cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbXwiki\u00bbVersion:6.3UpdateMilestone2cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:6.3:milestone2:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbXwiki\u00bbVersion:6.3UpdateRC1cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:6.3:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "40.90% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 97 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-26  38.27%  40.90%  +2.62 \n 2  2024-10-20  38.26%  38.27%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-09-26  41.17%  38.26%  -2.91 \n 4  2024-09-15  45.58%  41.17%  -4.41 \n 5  2024-09-03  56.78%  45.58%  -11.19 \n 6  2024-08-23  53.12%  56.78%  +3.66 \n 7  2024-08-01  55.94%  53.12%  -2.82 \n 8  2024-07-19  61.70%  55.94%  -5.76 \n 9  2024-07-08  50.79%  61.70%  +10.92 \n 10  2024-06-19  0.06%  50.79%  +50.72 \n 11  2023-11-30  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-285 Improper Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/285/Improper-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-21138", "ref_desc": "[XWIKI-21138] Whole content of all documents of all wikis exposed to anybody with view right on Solr suggest service - XWiki.org JIRAIssue Tracking;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/93b8ec702d7075f0f5794bb05dfb651382596764", "ref_desc": "XWIKI-21138: Improve Solr query filtering \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform@93b8ec7 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-7fqr-97j7-jgf4", "ref_desc": "Whole content of all documents of all wikis exposed to anybody with view right on Solr suggest service \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
