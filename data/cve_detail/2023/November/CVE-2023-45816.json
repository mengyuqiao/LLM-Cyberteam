{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-45816", "Description": "Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. Prior to version 3.1.3 of the `stable` branch and version 3.2.0.beta3 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, there is an edge case where a bookmark reminder is sent and an unread notification is generated, but the underlying bookmarkable (e.g. post, topic, chat message) security has changed, making it so the user can no longer access the underlying resource. As of version 3.1.3 of the `stable` branch and version 3.2.0.beta3 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, bookmark reminders are now no longer sent if the user does not have access to the underlying bookmarkable, and also the unread bookmark notifications are always filtered by access. There are no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45816", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bb     StableEditionVersions  before (<) 3.1.3cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:*:*:*:*:stable:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bb     BetaEditionVersions  before (<) 3.2.0cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:*:*:*:*:beta:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bbVersion:3.2.0UpdateBeta1   BetaEditioncpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:3.2.0:beta1:*:*:beta:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bbVersion:3.2.0UpdateBeta2   BetaEditioncpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:3.2.0:beta2:*:*:beta:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 14 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-11-17  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commit/3c5fb871c0f54af47679ae71ad449666b01d8216", "ref_desc": "SECURITY: Filter unread bookmark reminders the user cannot see \u00b7 discourse/discourse@3c5fb87 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/security/advisories/GHSA-v9r6-92wp-f6cf", "ref_desc": "Unread bookmark reminder notifications that the user cannot access can be seen \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 discourse/discourse \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commit/2c45b949ea0e9d6fa8e5af2dd07f6521ede08bf1", "ref_desc": "SECURITY: Filter unread bookmark reminders the user cannot see \u00b7 discourse/discourse@2c45b94 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
