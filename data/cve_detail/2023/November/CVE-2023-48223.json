{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-48223", "Description": "fast-jwt provides fast JSON Web Token (JWT) implementation. Prior to version 3.3.2, the fast-jwt library does not properly prevent JWT algorithm confusion for all public key types. The 'publicKeyPemMatcher' in 'fast-jwt/src/crypto.js' does not properly match all common PEM formats for public keys. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to craft a malicious JWT token containing the HS256 algorithm, signed with the public RSA key of the victim application. This attack will only work if the victim application utilizes a public key containing the `BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY` header. Applications using the RS256 algorithm, a public key with a `BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY` header, and calling the verify function without explicitly providing an algorithm, are vulnerable to this algorithm confusion attack which allows attackers to sign arbitrary payloads which will be accepted by the verifier. Version 3.3.2 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, change line 29 of `blob/master/src/crypto.js` to include a regular expression.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-48223", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nNearform\u00bbFast-jwt\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 3.3.2cpe:2.3:a:nearform:fast-jwt:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 35 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-26  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-10-20  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-11-30  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nearform/fast-jwt/blob/master/src/crypto.js#L29", "ref_desc": "fast-jwt/src/crypto.js at master \u00b7 nearform/fast-jwt \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nearform/fast-jwt/security/advisories/GHSA-c2ff-88x2-x9pg", "ref_desc": "JWT Algorithm Confusion \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nearform/fast-jwt \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nearform/fast-jwt/releases/tag/v3.3.2", "ref_desc": "Release v3.3.2 \u00b7 nearform/fast-jwt \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
