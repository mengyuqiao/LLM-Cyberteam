{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-46730", "Description": "Group-Office is an enterprise CRM and groupware tool. In affected versions there is full Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the /api/upload.php endpoint. The /api/upload.php endpoint does not filter URLs which allows a malicious user to cause the server to make resource requests to untrusted domains. Note that protocols like file:// can also be used to access the server disk. The request result (on success) can then be retrieved using /api/download.php. This issue has been addressed in versions 6.8.15, 6.7.54, and 6.6.177. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46730", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nGroup-office\u00bbGroup OfficeVersions  from including (>=) 6.3.1andbefore (<) 6.6.177cpe:2.3:a:group-office:group_office:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGroup-office\u00bbGroup OfficeVersions  from including (>=) 6.7.0andbefore (<) 6.7.54cpe:2.3:a:group-office:group_office:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGroup-office\u00bbGroup OfficeVersions  from including (>=) 6.8.0andbefore (<) 6.8.15cpe:2.3:a:group-office:group_office:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-13  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-10-07  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-11-15  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Intermesh/groupoffice/commit/99205535e8cec6592fd7f1469837926f27c72d50", "ref_desc": "Fix security issue GHSA-vw6c-h82w-mvfv \u00b7 Intermesh/groupoffice@9920553 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Intermesh/groupoffice/security/advisories/GHSA-vw6c-h82w-mvfv", "ref_desc": "SSRF in /api/upload.php \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Intermesh/groupoffice \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
