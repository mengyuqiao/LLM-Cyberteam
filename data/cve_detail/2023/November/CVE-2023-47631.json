{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-47631", "Description": "vantage6 is a framework to manage and deploy privacy enhancing technologies like Federated Learning (FL) and Multi-Party Computation (MPC). In affected versions a node does not check if an image is allowed to run if a `parent_id` is set. A malicious party that breaches the server may modify it to set a fake `parent_id` and send a task of a non-whitelisted algorithm. The node will then execute it because the `parent_id` that is set prevents checks from being run. This impacts all servers that are breached by an expert user. This vulnerability has been patched in version 4.1.2. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-47631", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nVantage6\u00bbVantage6Versions  before (<) 4.1.2cpe:2.3:a:vantage6:vantage6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nVantage6\u00bbVantage6\u00bbVersion:4.1.2UpdateRC1cpe:2.3:a:vantage6:vantage6:4.1.2:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-20  0.08%  0.14%  +0.06 \n 2  2024-10-14  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-09-20  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-11-30  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-345 Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/345/Insufficient-Verification-of-Data-Authenticity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/commit/bf83521eb12fa80aa5fc92ef1692010a9a7f8243", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-vc3v-ppc7-v486 \u00b7 vantage6/vantage6@bf83521 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/blob/version/4.1.1/vantage6-node/vantage6/node/docker/docker_manager.py#L265-L268", "ref_desc": "vantage6/vantage6-node/vantage6/node/docker/docker_manager.py at version/4.1.1 \u00b7 vantage6/vantage6 \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/security/advisories/GHSA-vc3v-ppc7-v486", "ref_desc": "Node accepts non-whitelisted algorithms from malicious server \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 vantage6/vantage6 \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
