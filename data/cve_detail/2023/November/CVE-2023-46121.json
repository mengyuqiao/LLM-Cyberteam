{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-46121", "Description": "yt-dlp is a youtube-dl fork with additional features and fixes. The Generic Extractor in yt-dlp is vulnerable to an attacker setting an arbitrary proxy for a request to an arbitrary url, allowing the attacker to MITM the request made from yt-dlp's HTTP session. This could lead to cookie exfiltration in some cases. Version 2023.11.14 removed the ability to smuggle `http_headers` to the Generic extractor, as well as other extractors that use the same pattern. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should disable the Ggneric extractor (or only pass trusted sites with trusted content) and ake caution when using `--no-check-certificate`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46121", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nYt-dlp Project\u00bbYt-dlpVersions  from including (>=) 2022.10.04andbefore (<) 2023.11.14cpe:2.3:a:yt-dlp_project:yt-dlp:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-20  0.06%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-10-14  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-11-23  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-444 Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/444/Inconsistent-Interpretation-of-HTTP-Requests-HTTP-Request-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/tag/2023.11.14", "ref_desc": "Release yt-dlp 2023.11.14 \u00b7 yt-dlp/yt-dlp \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/security/advisories/GHSA-3ch3-jhc6-5r8x", "ref_desc": "Generic Extractor MITM Vulnerability via Arbitrary Proxy Injection \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 yt-dlp/yt-dlp \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/commit/f04b5bedad7b281bee9814686bba1762bae092eb", "ref_desc": "[ie] Do not smuggle `http_headers` \u00b7 yt-dlp/yt-dlp@f04b5be \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
