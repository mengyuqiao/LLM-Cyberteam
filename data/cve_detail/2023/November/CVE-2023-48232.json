{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-48232", "Description": "Vim is an open source command line text editor. A floating point exception may occur when calculating the line offset for overlong lines and smooth scrolling is enabled and the cpo-settings include the 'n' flag. This may happen when a window border is present and when the wrapped line continues on the next physical line directly in the window border because the 'cpo' setting includes the 'n' flag. Only users with non-default settings are affected and the exception should only result in a crash. This issue has been addressed in commit `cb0b99f0` which has been included in release version 9.0.2107. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-48232", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:37cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:37:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:38cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:38:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:39cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:39:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nVIM\u00bbVIMVersions  before (<) 9.0.2107cpe:2.3:a:vim:vim:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-22  0.12%  0.16%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-10-16  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-01-26  0.07%  0.10%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-12-28  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-11-26  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-11-25  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-755 Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/755/Improper-Handling-of-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231227-0006/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-48232 Vim Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4UJAK2W5S7G75ETDAEM3BDUCVSXCEGRD/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 37 Update: vim-9.0.2120-1.fc37 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/6uV4Ay9G0lz2uRiFzvKlqUSu4cU.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vim/vim/security/advisories/GHSA-f6cx-x634-hqpw", "ref_desc": "Floating point Exception in adjust_plines_for_skipcol() \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 vim/vim \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/M3VQF7CL3V6FGSEW37WNDFBRRILR65AK/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 39 Update: vim-9.0.2120-1.fc39 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/lsSxy7I3wXAV92dlrr9JRuWZgRQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/cb0b99f0672d8446585d26e998343dceca17d1ce", "ref_desc": "patch 9.0.2107: [security]: FPE in adjust_plines_for_skipcol \u00b7 vim/vim@cb0b99f \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/11/16/1", "ref_desc": "oss-security - [vim-security] several minor security issues in Vim v9.0.2106-v9.0.2112Mailing ListCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/srSiA4rL3OeuCB_zkv4zqG8oOvE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VNRNYLWXZOGTYWE5HMFNQ5FVE3HBUHF6/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 38 Update: vim-9.0.2120-1.fc38 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/wY6gYIgsSnlrMJ4WAt9qclNKAAA.html"}]}
