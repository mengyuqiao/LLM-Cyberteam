{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-48706", "Description": "Vim is a UNIX editor that, prior to version 9.0.2121, has a heap-use-after-free vulnerability. When executing a `:s` command for the very first time and using a sub-replace-special atom inside the substitution part, it is possible that the recursive `:s` call causes free-ing of memory which may later then be accessed by the initial `:s` command. The user must intentionally execute the payload and the whole process is a bit tricky to do since it seems to work only reliably for the very first :s command. It may also cause a crash of Vim. Version 9.0.2121 contains a fix for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-48706", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nVIM\u00bbVIMVersions  before (<) 9.0.2121cpe:2.3:a:vim:vim:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 16 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-12-17  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-12-02  0.05%  0.04%  -0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-416 Use After Free", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/416/Use-After-Free.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vim/vim/security/advisories/GHSA-c8qm-x72m-q53q", "ref_desc": "heap-use-after-free in ex_substitute \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 vim/vim \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vim/vim/pull/13552", "ref_desc": "[use-after-free] in ex_substitute by chrisbra \u00b7 Pull Request #13552 \u00b7 vim/vim \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/26c11c56888d01e298cd8044caf860f3c26f57bb", "ref_desc": "patch 9.0.2121: [security]: use-after-free in ex_substitute \u00b7 vim/vim@26c11c5 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gandalf4a/crash_report/blob/main/vim/vim_huaf", "ref_desc": "crash_report/vim/vim_huaf at main \u00b7 gandalf4a/crash_report \u00b7 GitHubExploit", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/IVA7K73WHQH4KVFDJQ7ELIUD2WK5ZT5E/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 38 Update: vim-9.0.2167-1.fc38 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/sMBUF70-JNonM5slhtSsaJOSnUk.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/11/22/3", "ref_desc": "oss-security - [vim-security] use-after-free in ex_substitute in Vim < v9.0.2121Mailing List;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240105-0001/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-48706 Vim Vulnerability in NetApp Products | NetApp Product Security", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DNMFS3IH74KEMMESOA3EOB6MZ56TWGFF/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 39 Update: vim-9.0.2167-1.fc39 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/z6-UxQu4dk9SGKE6Vk0MpKh2aP0.html"}]}
