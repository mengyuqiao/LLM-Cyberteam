{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-49087", "Description": "xml-security is a library that implements XML signatures and encryption. Validation of an XML signature requires verification that the hash value of the related XML-document matches a specific DigestValue-value, but also that the cryptographic signature on the SignedInfo-tree (the one that contains the DigestValue) verifies and matches a trusted public key. If an attacker somehow (i.e. by exploiting a bug in PHP's canonicalization function) manages to manipulate the canonicalized version's DigestValue, it would be possible to forge the signature. This issue has been patched in version 1.6.12 and 5.0.0-alpha.13.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-49087", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSimplesamlphp\u00bbSaml2\u00bbVersion:5.0.0UpdateAlpha12cpe:2.3:a:simplesamlphp:saml2:5.0.0:alpha12:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSimplesamlphp\u00bbXml-security\u00bbVersion:1.6.11cpe:2.3:a:simplesamlphp:xml-security:1.6.11:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 23 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-30  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-12-07  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-345 Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/345/Insufficient-Verification-of-Data-Authenticity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/simplesamlphp/xml-security/security/advisories/GHSA-ww7x-3gxh-qm6r", "ref_desc": "Validation of SignedInfo \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 simplesamlphp/xml-security \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/simplesamlphp/xml-security/commit/f509e3083dd7870cce5880c804b5122317287581", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-ww7x-3gxh-qm6r \u00b7 simplesamlphp/xml-security@f509e30 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
