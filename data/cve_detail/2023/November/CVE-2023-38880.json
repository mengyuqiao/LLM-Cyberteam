Whenever an admin generates a database backup, the backup is stored in the web root while the file name has a format of \"opensisBackup<date>.sql\" (e.g. \"opensisBackup07-20-2023.sql\"), i.e. can easily be guessed. This file can be accessed by any unauthenticated actor and contains a dump of the whole database including password hashes.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-38880", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOs4ed\u00bbOpensis\u00bbVersion:9.0    CommunityEditioncpe:2.3:a:os4ed:opensis:9.0:*:*:*:community:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-26  0.07%  0.12%  +0.05 \n 2  2024-10-20  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-11-30  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.os4ed.com/", "ref_desc": "Open Solutions for EducationProductCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/qy-o5eBhT05uMYMnd5vxHleOrnc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/dub-flow/vulnerability-research/tree/main/CVE-2023-38880", "ref_desc": "vulnerability-research/CVE-2023-38880 at main \u00b7 dub-flow/vulnerability-research \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OS4ED/openSIS-Classic", "ref_desc": "GitHub - OS4ED/openSIS-Classic: openSIS is a commercial grade, secure, scalable & intuitive Student Information System, School Management Software from OS4ED.
