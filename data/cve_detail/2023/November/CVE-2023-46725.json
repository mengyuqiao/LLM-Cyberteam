{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-46725", "Description": "FoodCoopShop is open source software for food coops and local shops. Versions starting with 3.2.0 prior to 3.6.1 are vulnerable to server-side request forgery. In the Network module, a manufacturer account can use the `/api/updateProducts.json` endpoint to make the server send a request to an arbitrary host. This means that the server can be used as a proxy into the internal network where the server is. Furthermore, the checks on a valid image are not adequate, leading to a time of check time of use issue. For example, by using a custom server that returns 200 on HEAD requests, then return a valid image on first GET request and then a 302 redirect to final target on second GET request, the server will copy whatever file is at the redirect destination, making this a full SSRF. Version 3.6.1 fixes this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46725", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nFoodcoopshop\u00bbFoodcoopshopVersions  from including (>=) 3.2.0andup to, including, (<=) 3.6.0cpe:2.3:a:foodcoopshop:foodcoopshop:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-08  0.08%  0.12%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-10-02  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-11-10  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-367 Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/367/Time-of-check-Time-of-use-TOCTOU-Race-Condition.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/foodcoopshop/foodcoopshop/commit/0d5bec5c4c22e1affe7fd321a30e3f3a4d99e808", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #972 from foodcoopshop/remotefile \u00b7 foodcoopshop/foodcoopshop@0d5bec5 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/foodcoopshop/foodcoopshop/security/advisories/GHSA-jhww-fx2j-3rf7", "ref_desc": "Potential SSRF vulnerability \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 foodcoopshop/foodcoopshop \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/foodcoopshop/foodcoopshop/pull/972", "ref_desc": "Remotefile security fix by mrothauer \u00b7 Pull Request #972 \u00b7 foodcoopshop/foodcoopshop \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://pastebin.com/8K5Brwbq", "ref_desc": "example - Pastebin.comNot Applicable", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
