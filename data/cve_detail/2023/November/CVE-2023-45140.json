{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-45140", "Description": "The Bastion provides authentication, authorization, traceability and auditability for SSH accesses. SCP and SFTP plugins don't honor group-based JIT MFA. Establishing a SCP/SFTP connection through The Bastion via a group access where MFA is enforced does not ask for additional factor. This abnormal behavior only applies to per-group-based JIT MFA. Other MFA setup types, such as Immediate MFA, JIT MFA on a per-plugin basis and JIT MFA on a per-account basis are not affected. This issue has been patched in version 3.14.15.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45140", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOVH\u00bbThe-bastionVersions  before (<) 3.14.15cpe:2.3:a:ovh:the-bastion:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 22 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-14  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-08  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-11-17  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ovh/the-bastion/releases/tag/v3.14.15", "ref_desc": "Release v3.14.15 \u00b7 ovh/the-bastion \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ovh/the-bastion/security/advisories/GHSA-pr4q-w883-pf5x", "ref_desc": "Group-based and account-based JIT MFA bypass on scp and sftp \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ovh/the-bastion \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
