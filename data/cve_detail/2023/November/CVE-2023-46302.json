{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-46302", "Description": "Apache Software Foundation Apache Submarine has a bug when serializing against yaml. The bug is caused by snakeyaml  https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1471 .\n\nApache Submarine uses JAXRS to define REST endpoints.  In order to\nhandle YAML requests (using application/yaml content-type), it defines\na YamlEntityProvider entity provider that will process all incoming\nYAML requests.  In order to unmarshal the request, the readFrom method\nis invoked, passing the entityStream containing the user-supplied data in `submarine-server/server-core/src/main/java/org/apache/submarine/server/utils/YamlUtils.java`.\n \nWe have now fixed this issue in the new version by replacing to `jackson-dataformat-yaml`.\nThis issue affects Apache Submarine: from 0.7.0 before 0.8.0.\u00a0Users are recommended to upgrade to version 0.8.0, which fixes this issue.\nIf using the version smaller than 0.8.0  and not want to upgrade, you can try cherry-pick PR  https://github.com/apache/submarine/pull/1054  and rebuild the submart-server image to fix this.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46302", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbSubmarineVersions  from including (>=) 0.7.0andbefore (<) 0.8.0cpe:2.3:a:apache:submarine:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 63 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-26  0.29%  0.24%  -0.05 \n 2  2024-11-15  0.32%  0.29%  -0.03 \n 3  2024-10-20  0.23%  0.32%  +0.09 \n 4  2024-10-09  0.21%  0.23%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-09-15  0.18%  0.21%  +0.03 \n 6  2024-08-23  0.23%  0.18%  -0.04 \n 7  2024-07-08  0.22%  0.23%  +0.01 \n 8  2024-06-28  0.20%  0.22%  +0.02 \n 9  2024-05-27  0.20%  0.20%  +0.01 \n 10  2024-03-31  0.17%  0.20%  +0.03 \n 11  2023-12-23  0.12%  0.17%  +0.05 \n 12  2023-12-01  0.05%  0.12%  +0.08 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/zf0wppzh239j4h131hm1dbswfnztxrr5", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-46302: Apache Submarine: Fix CVE-2022-1471 SnakeYaml unsafe deserialization-Apache Mail ArchivesMailing List", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SUBMARINE-1371", "ref_desc": "[SUBMARINE-1371] Fix unsafe deserialization via SnakeYaml in YamlEntityProvider - ASF JIRAExploit;Issue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/apache/submarine/pull/1054", "ref_desc": "SUBMARINE-1371. fix unsafe deserialization via SnakeYaml in YamlEntityProvider by cdmikechen \u00b7 Pull Request #1054 \u00b7 apache/submarine \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
