{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-48700", "Description": "The Nautobot Device Onboarding plugin uses the netmiko and NAPALM libraries to simplify the onboarding process of a new device into Nautobot down to, in many cases, an IP Address and a Location. Starting in version 2.0.0 and prior to version 3.0.0, credentials provided to onboarding task are visible via Job Results from an execution of an Onboarding Task. Version 3.0.0 fixes this issue; no known workarounds are available. Mitigation recommendations include deleting all Job Results for any onboarding task to remove clear text credentials from database entries that were run while on v2.0.X, upgrading to v3.0.0, and rotating any exposed credentials.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-48700", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNautobot\u00bbNautobot-plugin-device-onboardingVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 3.0.0cpe:2.3:a:nautobot:nautobot-plugin-device-onboarding:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-27  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-21  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-12-01  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-256 Plaintext Storage of a Password", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/256/Plaintext-Storage-of-a-Password.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-312 Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/312/Cleartext-Storage-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot-plugin-device-onboarding/security/advisories/GHSA-qf3c-rw9f-jh7v", "ref_desc": "Clear Text Credentials Exposed via Onboarding Task \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nautobot/nautobot-plugin-device-onboarding \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
