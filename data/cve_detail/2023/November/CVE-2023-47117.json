{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-47117", "Description": "Label Studio is an open source data labeling tool. In all current versions of Label Studio prior to 1.9.2post0, the application allows users to insecurely set filters for filtering tasks. An attacker can construct a filter chain to filter tasks based on sensitive fields for all user accounts on the platform by exploiting Django's Object Relational Mapper (ORM). Since the results of query can be manipulated by the ORM filter, an attacker can leak these sensitive fields character by character. In addition, Label Studio had a hard coded secret key that an attacker can use to forge a session token of any user by exploiting this ORM Leak vulnerability to leak account password hashes. This vulnerability has been addressed in commit `f931d9d129` which is included in the 1.9.2post0 release. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-47117", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nHumansignal\u00bbLabel StudioVersions  before (<) 1.9.2cpe:2.3:a:humansignal:label_studio:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nHumansignal\u00bbLabel Studio\u00bbVersion:1.9.2cpe:2.3:a:humansignal:label_studio:1.9.2:-:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "18.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 96 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-19  14.42%  18.21%  +3.79 \n 2  2024-10-13  11.94%  14.42%  +2.48 \n 3  2024-09-19  12.95%  11.94%  -1.01 \n 4  2024-08-16  12.69%  12.95%  +0.26 \n 5  2024-07-12  13.00%  12.69%  -0.31 \n 6  2024-07-09  0.09%  13.00%  +12.91 \n 7  2023-11-21  0.04%  0.09%  +0.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/commit/f931d9d129002f54a495995774ce7384174cef5c", "ref_desc": "fix: LEAP-237: Patch ORM Leak vulnerability in open source (#5012) \u00b7 HumanSignal/label-studio@f931d9d \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/security/advisories/GHSA-6hjj-gq77-j4qw", "ref_desc": "Object Relational Mapper Leak Vulnerability in Filtering Task \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 HumanSignal/label-studio \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Mitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
