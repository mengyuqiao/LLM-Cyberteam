{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-48240", "Description": "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. The rendered diff in XWiki embeds images to be able to compare the contents and not display a difference for an actually unchanged image. For this, XWiki requests all embedded images on the server side. These requests are also sent for images from other domains and include all cookies that were sent in the original request to ensure that images with restricted view right can be compared. Starting in version 11.10.1 and prior to versions 14.10.15, 15.5.1, and 15.6, this allows an attacker to steal login and session cookies that allow impersonating the current user who views the diff. The attack can be triggered with an image that references the rendered diff, thus making it easy to trigger. Apart from stealing login cookies, this also allows server-side request forgery (the result of any successful request is returned in the image's source) and viewing protected content as once a resource is cached, it is returned for all users. As only successful requests are cached, the cache will be filled by the first user who is allowed to access the resource. This has been patched in XWiki 14.10.15, 15.5.1 and 15.6. The rendered diff now only downloads images from trusted domains. Further, cookies are only sent when the image's domain is the same the requested domain. The cache has been changed to be specific for each user. As a workaround, the image embedding feature can be disabled by deleting `xwiki-platform-diff-xml-<version>.jar` in `WEB-INF/lib/`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-48240", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  from including (>=) 11.10.1andbefore (<) 14.10.15cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  from including (>=) 15.0andbefore (<) 15.5.1cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbXwiki\u00bbVersion:15.6UpdateRC1cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:15.6:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-26  0.08%  0.12%  +0.05 \n 2  2024-10-20  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-11-30  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-201 Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/201/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-Into-Sent-Data.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-281 Improper Preservation of Permissions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/281/Improper-Preservation-of-Permissions.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20818", "ref_desc": "[XWIKI-20818] Cookies are sent to external images in rendered diff (and server side request forgery) - XWiki.org JIRAIssue Tracking;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-7rfg-6273-f5wp", "ref_desc": "Cookies are sent to external images in rendered diff (and server side request forgery) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/bff0203e739b6e3eb90af5736f04278c73c2a8bb", "ref_desc": "XWIKI-20818: Improve data URI converter \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform@bff0203 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
