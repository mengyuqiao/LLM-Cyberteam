{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-22457", "Description": "CKEditor Integration UI adds support for editing wiki pages using CKEditor. Prior to versions 1.64.3,t he `CKEditor.HTMLConverter` document lacked a protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), allowing to execute macros with the rights of the current user. If a privileged user with programming rights was tricked into executing a GET request to this document with certain parameters (e.g., via an image with a corresponding URL embedded in a comment or via a redirect), this would allow arbitrary remote code execution and the attacker could gain rights, access private information or impact the availability of the wiki. The issue has been patched in the CKEditor Integration version 1.64.3. This has also been patched in the version of the CKEditor integration that is bundled starting with XWiki 14.6 RC1. There are no known workarounds for this other than upgrading the CKEditor integration to a fixed version.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-22457", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF);Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nXwiki\u00bbCkeditor Integration\u00bbForXwikiVersions  before (<) 1.64.3cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:ckeditor_integration:*:*:*:*:*:xwiki:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.51% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 87 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-23  1.52%  1.51%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-08-25  1.04%  1.52%  +0.48 \n 3  2024-08-11  0.85%  1.04%  +0.20 \n 4  2024-07-27  0.84%  0.85%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-06-16  0.85%  0.84%  -0.01 \n 6  2024-03-28  0.78%  0.85%  +0.07 \n 7  2024-02-06  0.71%  0.78%  +0.07 \n 8  2024-01-11  0.62%  0.71%  +0.09 \n 9  2023-12-31  0.48%  0.62%  +0.14 \n 10  2023-12-05  0.43%  0.48%  +0.05 \n 11  2023-05-08  0.89%  0.43%  -0.46 \n 12  2023-03-07  4.84%  0.89%  -3.95 \n 13  2023-01-11  3.92%  4.84%  +0.92 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/CKEDITOR-475", "ref_desc": "[CKEDITOR-475] Remote code execution via CSRF using the HTMLConverter - XWiki.org JIRAExploit;Issue Tracking;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/application-ckeditor/commit/6b1053164386aefc526df7512bc664918aa6849b", "ref_desc": "CKEDITOR-475: Add form token check to HTMLConverter \u00b7 xwiki-contrib/application-ckeditor@6b10531 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/application-ckeditor/security/advisories/GHSA-6mjp-2rm6-9g85", "ref_desc": "Remote Code Execution via Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in org.xwiki.contrib:application-ckeditor-ui \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 xwiki-contrib/application-ckeditor \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
