{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-22492", "Description": "ZITADEL is a combination of Auth0 and Keycloak. RefreshTokens is an OAuth 2.0 feature that allows applications to retrieve new access tokens and refresh the user's session without the need for interacting with a UI. RefreshTokens were not invalidated when a user was locked or deactivated. The deactivated or locked user was able to obtain a valid access token only through a refresh token grant. When the locked or deactivated user\u2019s session was already terminated (\u201clogged out\u201d) then it was not possible to create a new session. Renewal of access token through a refresh token grant is limited to the configured amount of time (RefreshTokenExpiration). As a workaround, ensure the RefreshTokenExpiration in the OIDC settings of your instance is set according to your security requirements. This issue has been patched in versions 2.17.3 and 2.16.4.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-22492", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nZitadel\u00bbZitadelVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.16.4cpe:2.3:a:zitadel:zitadel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nZitadel\u00bbZitadelVersions  from including (>=) 2.17.0andbefore (<) 2.17.3cpe:2.3:a:zitadel:zitadel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 45 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-03  0.11%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-06-23  0.11%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-02-13  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-01-18  0.07%  0.10%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-12-12  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.89 \n 7  2023-01-25  0.89%  0.95%  +0.06 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-613 Insufficient Session Expiration", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/613/Insufficient-Session-Expiration.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/commit/301e22c4956ead6014a8179463c37263f7301a83", "ref_desc": "fix: deactivate refresh tokens of deactivated or locked users \u00b7 zitadel/zitadel@301e22c \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/security/advisories/GHSA-6rrr-78xp-5jp8", "ref_desc": "RefreshToken invalidation vulnerability \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 zitadel/zitadel \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/commit/fc892c52a10cd4ffdac395747494f3a93a7494c2", "ref_desc": "fix: deactivate refresh tokens of deactivated or locked users \u00b7 zitadel/zitadel@fc892c5 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
