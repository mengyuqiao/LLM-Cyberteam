{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-24069", "Description": "Signal Desktop before 6.2.0 on Windows, Linux, and macOS allows an attacker to obtain potentially sensitive attachments sent in messages from the attachments.noindex directory. Cached attachments are not effectively cleared. In some cases, even after a self-initiated file deletion, an attacker can still recover the file if it was previously replied to in a conversation. (Local filesystem access is needed by the attacker.) NOTE: the vendor disputes the relevance of this finding because the product is not intended to protect against adversaries with this degree of local access.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-24069", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSignal\u00bbSignal-desktopVersions  up to, including, (<=) 6.2.0cpe:2.3:a:signal:signal-desktop:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Apple\u00bbMacos\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Linux\u00bbLinux Kernel\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-15  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.91 \n 3  2023-02-22  1.67%  0.95%  -0.72 \n 4  2023-01-24  0.95%  1.67%  +0.72 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://johnjhacking.com/blog/cve-2023-24068-cve-2023-24069/", "ref_desc": "John J HackingExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/6-GmnF8fIRQ0Wa6SQVqFkB34kbI.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://signal.org/download/linux", "ref_desc": "Signal >> Download Signal for LinuxProduct;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/6WpMhVDJ8jWaijkacQwyf0Mgcds.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://signal.org/download/macos", "ref_desc": "Signal >> Download Signal for MacProduct;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/O6TX7XktsC_KiosCzZVOd4FKhlQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://signal.org/en/download/windows", "ref_desc": "Signal >> Download Signal for WindowsProduct;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Z6n5y6NxTyMpJlhyWr_WenmSVeY.html"}]}
