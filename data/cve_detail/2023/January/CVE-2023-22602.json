{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-22602", "Description": "When using Apache Shiro before 1.11.0 together with Spring Boot 2.6+, a specially crafted HTTP request may cause an authentication bypass. The authentication bypass occurs when Shiro and Spring Boot are using different pattern-matching techniques. Both Shiro and Spring Boot < 2.6 default to Ant style pattern matching. Mitigation: Update to Apache Shiro 1.11.0, or set the following Spring Boot configuration value: `spring.mvc.pathmatch.matching-strategy = ant_path_matcher`", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-22602", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbShiroVersions  before (<) 1.11.0cpe:2.3:a:apache:shiro:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nVmware\u00bbSpring Boot\u00bbVersion:2.6.0Update+cpe:2.3:a:vmware:spring_boot:2.6.0:\\+:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.36% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 73 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-06  0.36%  0.36%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-02-16  0.36%  0.36%  -0.01 \n 3  2024-01-21  0.12%  0.36%  +0.24 \n 4  2023-12-04  0.09%  0.12%  +0.04 \n 5  2023-05-08  0.09%  0.09%  0.00 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-436 Interpretation Conflict", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/436/Interpretation-Conflict.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/dzj0k2smpzzgj6g666hrbrgsrlf9yhkl", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-22602: Apache Shiro before 1.11.0, when used with Spring Boot 2.6+, may allow authentication bypass through a specially crafted HTTP request-Apache Mail ArchivesMailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
