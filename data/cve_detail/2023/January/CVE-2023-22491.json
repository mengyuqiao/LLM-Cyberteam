{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-22491", "Description": "Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build websites and apps. The gatsby-transformer-remark plugin prior to versions 5.25.1 and 6.3.2 passes input through to the `gray-matter` npm package, which is vulnerable to JavaScript injection in its default configuration, unless input is sanitized. The vulnerability is present in gatsby-transformer-remark when passing input in data mode (querying MarkdownRemark nodes via GraphQL). Injected JavaScript executes in the context of the build server. To exploit this vulnerability untrusted/unsanitized input would need to be sourced by or added into a file processed by gatsby-transformer-remark. A patch has been introduced in `gatsby-transformer-remark@5.25.1` and `gatsby-transformer-remark@6.3.2` which mitigates the issue by disabling the `gray-matter` JavaScript Frontmatter engine. As a workaround, if an older version of `gatsby-transformer-remark` must be used, input passed into the plugin should be sanitized ahead of processing. It is encouraged for projects to upgrade to the latest major release branch for all Gatsby plugins to ensure the latest security updates and bug fixes are received in a timely manner.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-22491", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection;Cross site scripting (XSS);Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nGatsbyjs\u00bbGatsby\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 5.25.1cpe:2.3:a:gatsbyjs:gatsby:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions\nGatsbyjs\u00bbGatsby\u00bbVersion:6.3.1ForNode.jscpe:2.3:a:gatsbyjs:gatsby:6.3.1:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 24 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-05  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-01-20  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-12-14  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 \n 5  2023-02-23  2.56%  0.89%  -1.68 \n 6  2023-01-24  10.86%  2.56%  -8.29 \n 7  2023-01-18  0.89%  10.86%  +9.97 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/security/advisories/GHSA-7ch4-rr99-cqcw", "ref_desc": "Unsanitized JavaScript code injection possible in gatsby-transformer-remark \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 gatsbyjs/gatsby \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
