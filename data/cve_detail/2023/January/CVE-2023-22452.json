{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-22452", "Description": "kenny2automate is a Discord bot. In the web interface for server settings, form elements were generated with Discord channel IDs as part of input names. Prior to commit a947d7c, no validation was performed to ensure that the channel IDs submitted actually belonged to the server being configured. Thus anyone who has access to the channel ID they wish to change settings for and the server settings panel for any server could change settings for the requested channel no matter which server it belonged to. Commit a947d7c resolves the issue and has been deployed to the official instance of the bot. The only workaround that exists is to disable the web config entirely by changing it to run on localhost. Note that a workaround is only necessary for those who run their own instance of the bot.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-22452", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nKenny2automate Project\u00bbKenny2automateVersions  before (<) a947d7ccpe:2.3:a:kenny2automate_project:kenny2automate:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 20 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-25  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-12-03  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Kenny2github/kenny2automate/security/advisories/GHSA-73j8-xrcr-q6j7", "ref_desc": "Improper Input Validation in kenny2automate \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Kenny2github/kenny2automate \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Kenny2github/kenny2automate/commit/a947d7ce408687b587c7e6dfd6026f7c4ee31ac2", "ref_desc": "SECURITY: Prevent changing other servers' settings \u00b7 Kenny2github/kenny2automate@a947d7c \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
