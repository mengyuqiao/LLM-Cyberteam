{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-22456", "Description": "ViewVC, a browser interface for CVS and Subversion version control repositories, as a cross-site scripting vulnerability that affects versions prior to 1.2.2 and 1.1.29. The impact of this vulnerability is mitigated by the need for an attacker to have commit privileges to a Subversion repository exposed by an otherwise trusted ViewVC instance. The attack vector involves files with unsafe names (names that, when embedded into an HTML stream, would cause the browser to run unwanted code), which themselves can be challenging to create. Users should update to at least version 1.2.2 (if they are using a 1.2.x version of ViewVC) or 1.1.29 (if they are using a 1.1.x version). ViewVC 1.0.x is no longer supported, so users of that release lineage should implement a workaround. Users can edit their ViewVC EZT view templates to manually HTML-escape changed paths during rendering. Locate in your template set's `revision.ezt` file references to those changed paths, and wrap them with `[format \"html\"]` and `[end]`. For most users, that means that references to `[changes.path]` will become `[format \"html\"][changes.path][end]`. (This workaround should be reverted after upgrading to a patched version of ViewVC, else changed path names will be doubly escaped.)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-22456", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nViewvc\u00bbViewvcVersions  from including (>=) 1.2.0andbefore (<) 1.2.2cpe:2.3:a:viewvc:viewvc:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nViewvc\u00bbViewvcVersions  before (<) 1.1.29cpe:2.3:a:viewvc:viewvc:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-26  0.10%  0.10%  0.00 \n 2  2024-06-15  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-02-05  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-01-10  0.05%  0.08%  +0.03 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.05%  -0.97 \n 6  2023-02-23  4.13%  1.02%  -3.12 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/viewvc/viewvc/releases/tag/1.2.2", "ref_desc": "Release ViewVC 1.2.2 \u00b7 viewvc/viewvc \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/viewvc/viewvc/issues/311", "ref_desc": "XSS in changed paths when reviewing revision \u00b7 Issue #311 \u00b7 viewvc/viewvc \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/RZ_b9sMBQ-E13vqVuNg2xeIL9Kc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/viewvc/viewvc/releases/tag/1.1.29", "ref_desc": "Release ViewVC 1.1.29 \u00b7 viewvc/viewvc \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/viewvc/viewvc/security/advisories/GHSA-j4mx-f97j-gc5g", "ref_desc": "XSS vulnerability in revision view changed paths \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 viewvc/viewvc \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
