{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-0550", "Description": "The Quick Restaurant Menu plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in versions up to, and including, 2.0.2. This is due to the fact that during menu item deletion/modification, the plugin does not verify that the post ID provided to the AJAX action is indeed a menu item. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access or higher, to modify or delete arbitrary posts.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-0550", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nThingsforrestaurants\u00bbQuick Restaurant Menu\u00bbForWordpressVersions  before (<) 2.1.0cpe:2.3:a:thingsforrestaurants:quick_restaurant_menu:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-19  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-02-03  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-12-28  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-639 Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/639/Authorization-Bypass-Through-User-Controlled-Key.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2851871/quick-restaurant-menu/trunk?contextall=1&old=2788636&old_path=%2Fquick-restaurant-menu%2Ftrunk", "ref_desc": "Patch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/EzdusOhaBiTiPaNpoD-UjN8azJQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/faa4fba5-cd19-4b96-aa09-07ed6d52a107", "ref_desc": "Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/quick-restaurant-menu/tags/2.0.2/includes/admin/ajax-functions.php", "ref_desc": "Patch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Wi-XaLImOz2U_BYiyYkB6JizWBo.html"}]}
