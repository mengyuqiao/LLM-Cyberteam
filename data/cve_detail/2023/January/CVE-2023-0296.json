{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-0296", "Description": "The Birthday attack against 64-bit block ciphers flaw (CVE-2016-2183) was reported for the health checks port (9979) on etcd grpc-proxy component. Even though the CVE-2016-2183 has been fixed in the etcd components, to enable periodic health checks from kubelet, it was necessary to open up a new port (9979) on etcd grpc-proxy, hence this port might be considered as still vulnerable to the same type of vulnerability. The health checks on etcd grpc-proxy do not contain sensitive data (only metrics data), therefore the potential impact related to this vulnerability is minimal. The CVE-2023-0296 has been assigned to this issue to track the permanent fix in the etcd component.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-0296", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nRedhat\u00bbOpenshift\u00bbVersion:4.11cpe:2.3:a:redhat:openshift:4.11:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 32 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-09  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-06-29  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-01-24  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-12-18  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 \n 6  2023-02-13  1.02%  0.89%  -0.13 \n 7  2023-02-03  0.89%  1.02%  +0.13 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-327 Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/327/Use-of-a-Broken-or-Risky-Cryptographic-Algorithm.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2161287", "ref_desc": "2161287 \u2013 (CVE-2023-0296) CVE-2023-0296 openshift: etcd grpc-proxy vulnerable to The Birthday attack against 64-bit block cipherIssue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
