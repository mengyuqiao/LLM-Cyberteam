{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-48217", "Description": "The tf_remapper_node component 1.1.1 for Robot Operating System (ROS) allows attackers, who control the source code of a different node in the same ROS application, to change a robot's behavior. This occurs because a topic name depends on the attacker-controlled old_tf_topic_name and/or new_tf_topic_name parameter. NOTE: the vendor's position is \"it is the responsibility of the programmer to make sure that only known and required parameters are set and unexpected parameters are not.\"", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-48217", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nTradr-project\u00bbTf Remapper\u00bbVersion:1.1.1ForRobot Operating Systemcpe:2.3:a:tradr-project:tf_remapper:1.1.1:*:*:*:*:robot_operating_system:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 62 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-27  0.21%  0.24%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-06-16  0.19%  0.21%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-02-06  0.16%  0.19%  +0.04 \n 4  2024-01-11  0.12%  0.16%  +0.04 \n 5  2023-12-05  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.11%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-75 Failure to Sanitize Special Elements into a Different Plane (Special Element Injection)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/75/Failure-to-Sanitize-Special-Elements-into-a-Different-Plane-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tradr-project/tf_remapper_cpp/issues/1", "ref_desc": "Potential vulnerability: topic names from ROS parameters \u00b7 Issue #1 \u00b7 tradr-project/tf_remapper_cpp \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
