{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-22727", "Description": "CakePHP is a development framework for PHP web apps. In affected versions the `Cake\\Database\\Query::limit()` and `Cake\\Database\\Query::offset()` methods are vulnerable to SQL injection if passed un-sanitized user request data. This issue has been fixed in 4.2.12, 4.3.11, 4.4.10. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate this issue by using CakePHP's Pagination library. Manually validating or casting parameters to these methods will also mitigate the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-22727", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nCakephp\u00bbCakephpVersions  from including (>=) 4.3.0andbefore (<) 4.3.11cpe:2.3:a:cakephp:cakephp:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCakephp\u00bbCakephpVersions  from including (>=) 4.4.0andbefore (<) 4.4.10cpe:2.3:a:cakephp:cakephp:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCakephp\u00bbCakephpVersions  from including (>=) 4.2.0andbefore (<) 4.2.12cpe:2.3:a:cakephp:cakephp:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 56 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-09  0.18%  0.19%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-06-29  0.16%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-02-19  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-01-24  0.08%  0.14%  +0.06 \n 5  2023-12-18  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-05-08  0.08%  0.07%  -0.01 \n 7  2023-04-26  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.07%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/commit/3f463e7084b5a15e67205ced3a622577cca7a239", "ref_desc": "Disallow strings in limit() and offset() \u00b7 cakephp/cakephp@3f463e7 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bakery.cakephp.org/2023/01/06/cakephp_4211_4311_4410_released.html", "ref_desc": "CakePHP 4.2.11, 4.3.11, and 4.4.10 Released \u2014 BakeryRelease Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/security/advisories/GHSA-6g8q-qfpv-57wp", "ref_desc": "Database\\Query::offset() and limit() vulnerable to SQL injection \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 cakephp/cakephp \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
