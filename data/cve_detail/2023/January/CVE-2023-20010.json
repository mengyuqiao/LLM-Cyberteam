{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-20010", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM) and Cisco Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition (Unified CM SME) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct SQL injection attacks on an affected system.\r\n\r This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface inadequately validates user input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the application as a low-privileged user and sending crafted SQL queries to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read or modify any data on the underlying database or elevate their privileges.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-20010", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbUnified Communications Manager\u00bbVersions  from including (>=) 14.0andbefore (<) 14su2cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_communications_manager:*:*:*:*:-:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbUnified Communications Manager\u00bb     Session ManagementEditionVersions  before (<) 12.5\\(1\\)su7cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_communications_manager:*:*:*:*:session_management:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbUnified Communications Manager\u00bb     Session ManagementEditionVersions  from including (>=) 14.0andbefore (<) 14su2cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_communications_manager:*:*:*:*:session_management:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbUnified Communications Manager\u00bbVersions  from including (>=) 11.5\\(1\\)andbefore (<) 12.5\\(1\\)su7cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_communications_manager:*:*:*:*:-:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-11  0.08%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-01-27  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-12-21  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-05-08  0.06%  0.05%  -0.01 \n 5  2023-04-29  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.05%  -1.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cucm-sql-rpPczR8n", "ref_desc": "Cisco Unified Communications Manager SQL Injection VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
