{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-22485", "Description": "cmark-gfm is GitHub's fork of cmark, a CommonMark parsing and rendering library and program in C. In versions prior 0.29.0.gfm.7, a crafted markdown document can trigger an out-of-bounds read in the `validate_protocol` function. We believe this bug is harmless in practice, because the out-of-bounds read accesses `malloc` metadata without causing any visible damage.This vulnerability has been patched in 0.29.0.gfm.7.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-22485", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGithub\u00bbCmark-gfmVersions  before (<) 0.29.0.gfm.7cpe:2.3:a:github:cmark-gfm:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-16  0.09%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-06  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-02-26  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-01-30  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-12-24  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-91 XML Injection (aka Blind XPath Injection)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/91/XML-Injection-aka-Blind-XPath-Injection-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm/security/advisories/GHSA-c944-cv5f-hpvr", "ref_desc": "out-of-bounds read in validate_protocol \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 github/cmark-gfm \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
