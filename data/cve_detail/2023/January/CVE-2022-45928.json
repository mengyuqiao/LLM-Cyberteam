{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-45928", "Description": "A remote OScript execution issue was discovered in OpenText Content Suite Platform 22.1 (16.2.19.1803). Multiple endpoints allow the user to pass the parameter htmlFile, which is included in the HTML output rendering pipeline of a request. Because the Content Server evaluates and executes Oscript code in HTML files, it is possible for an attacker to execute Oscript code. The Oscript scripting language allows the attacker (for example) to manipulate files on the filesystem, create new network connections, or execute OS commands.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-45928", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOpentext\u00bbOpentext Extended EcmVersions  from including (>=) 16.2.2andup to, including, (<=) 22.3cpe:2.3:a:opentext:opentext_extended_ecm:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.45% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 76 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-06  0.37%  0.45%  +0.08 \n 2  2024-10-07  0.37%  0.37%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-09-08  0.26%  0.37%  +0.11 \n 4  2024-08-25  0.26%  0.26%  +0.00 \n 5  2024-08-10  0.22%  0.26%  +0.03 \n 6  2024-06-30  0.24%  0.22%  -0.02 \n 7  2024-01-25  0.11%  0.24%  +0.13 \n 8  2023-12-19  0.13%  0.11%  -0.02 \n 9  2023-11-25  0.11%  0.13%  +0.02 \n 10  2023-07-08  0.13%  0.11%  -0.02 \n 11  2023-05-23  0.14%  0.13%  -0.01 \n 12  2023-05-08  0.10%  0.14%  +0.04 \n 13  2023-03-07  2.20%  0.10%  -2.10 \n 14  2023-01-26  1.55%  2.20%  +0.65 \n 15  2023-01-21  2.49%  1.55%  -0.94 \n 16  2023-01-20  2.56%  2.49%  -0.07 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Jan/14", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: SEC Consult SA-20230117-2 :: Multiple post-authentication vulnerabilities including RCE in @OpenText Content Server component of OpenText Extended ECMExploit;Mailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/8-W_iqvJEUAo2Ya3fcMdInDF-Jw.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/170615/OpenText-Extended-ECM-22.3-File-Deletion-LFI-Privilege-Escsalation.html", "ref_desc": "OpenText Extended ECM 22.3 File Deletion / LFI / Privilege Escsalation \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Gma2wkf6qkKAgARhoyLCLee6Ho8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://sec-consult.com/vulnerability-lab/advisory/multiple-post-authentication-vulnerabilities-including-rce-opentexttm-extended-ecm/", "ref_desc": "Multiple post-authentication vulnerabilities including RCE (OpenText\u2122 Extended ECM)Exploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Z-IXICiZc_NkJEZom5m5j77iCtc.html"}]}
