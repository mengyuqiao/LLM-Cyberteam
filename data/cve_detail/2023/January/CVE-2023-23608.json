{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-23608", "Description": "Spotipy is a light weight Python library for the Spotify Web API. In versions prior to 2.22.1, if a malicious URI is passed to the library, the library can be tricked into performing an operation on a different API endpoint than intended. The code Spotipy uses to parse URIs and URLs allows an attacker to insert arbitrary characters into the path that is used for API requests. Because it is possible to include \"..\", an attacker can redirect for example a track lookup via spotifyApi.track() to an arbitrary API endpoint like playlists, but this is possible for other endpoints as well. The impact of this vulnerability depends heavily on what operations a client application performs when it handles a URI from a user and how it uses the responses it receives from the API. This issue is patched in version 2.22.1.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-23608", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nSpotipy Project\u00bbSpotipyVersions  before (<) 2.22.1cpe:2.3:a:spotipy_project:spotipy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 35 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-16  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-07-06  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-01-30  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-12-24  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/spotipy-dev/spotipy/security/advisories/GHSA-q764-g6fm-555v", "ref_desc": "Path traversal vulnerability that may lead to type confusion in URI handling code \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 spotipy-dev/spotipy \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
