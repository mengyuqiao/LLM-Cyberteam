{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-22726", "Description": "act is a project which allows for local running of github actions. The artifact server that stores artifacts from Github Action runs does not sanitize path inputs. This allows an attacker to download and overwrite arbitrary files on the host from a Github Action. This issue may lead to privilege escalation. The /upload endpoint is vulnerable to path traversal as filepath is user controlled, and ultimately flows into os.Mkdir and os.Open. The /artifact endpoint is vulnerable to path traversal as the path is variable is user controlled, and the specified file is ultimately returned by the server. This has been addressed in version 0.2.40. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may, during implementation of Open and OpenAtEnd for FS, ensure to use ValidPath() to check against path traversal or clean the user-provided paths manually.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-22726", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nAct Project\u00bbACT\u00bbForGOVersions  before (<) 0.2.40cpe:2.3:a:act_project:act:*:*:*:*:*:go:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.49% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 77 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-10  0.56%  0.49%  -0.07 \n 2  2024-08-27  0.46%  0.56%  +0.10 \n 3  2024-08-12  0.30%  0.46%  +0.17 \n 4  2024-05-30  0.29%  0.30%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-05-23  0.20%  0.29%  +0.09 \n 6  2024-04-26  0.18%  0.20%  +0.02 \n 7  2024-01-27  0.11%  0.18%  +0.07 \n 8  2023-12-21  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 9  2023-03-07  1.03%  0.09%  -0.94 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nektos/act/blob/v0.2.35/pkg/artifacts/server.go#L245", "ref_desc": "act/server.go at v0.2.35 \u00b7 nektos/act \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nektos/act/commit/63ae215071f94569d910964bdee866d91d6e3a10", "ref_desc": "fix: update artifact server to address GHSL-2023-004 (#1565) \u00b7 nektos/act@63ae215 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nektos/act/issues/1553", "ref_desc": "Github Security Lab: GHSL-2023-004 \u00b7 Issue #1553 \u00b7 nektos/act \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2023-004_act/", "ref_desc": "GHSL-2023-004: Arbitrary file upload and download in act - CVE-2023-22726 | GitHub Security LabExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nektos/act/security/advisories/GHSA-pc99-qmg4-rcff", "ref_desc": "Github Security Lab: GHSL-2023-004 \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nektos/act \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nektos/act/blob/master/pkg/artifacts/server.go#L65", "ref_desc": "act/server.go at master \u00b7 nektos/act \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nektos/act/blob/v0.2.35/pkg/artifacts/server.go#LL103C2-L103C2", "ref_desc": "act/server.go at v0.2.35 \u00b7 nektos/act \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
