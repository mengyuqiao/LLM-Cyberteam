{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-20047", "Description": "A vulnerability in the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) feature of Cisco Webex Room Phone and Cisco Webex Share devices could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to insufficient resource allocation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted LLDP traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust the memory resources of the affected device, resulting in a crash of the LLDP process. If the affected device is configured to support LLDP only, this could cause an interruption to inbound and outbound calling. By default, these devices are configured to support both Cisco Discovery Protocol and LLDP. To recover operational state, the affected device needs a manual restart.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-20047", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbWebex Room Phone FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.2.0cpe:2.3:o:cisco:webex_room_phone_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbWebex Room Phone\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbWebex Share FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.2.0cpe:2.3:o:cisco:webex_share_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbWebex Share\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbSip Ip Phone SoftwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.2.0cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sip_ip_phone_software:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 20 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-11  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-07-01  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-lldp-memlk-McOecPT", "ref_desc": "Cisco Webex Room Phone and Cisco Webex Share Link Layer Discovery Protocol Memory Leak VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
