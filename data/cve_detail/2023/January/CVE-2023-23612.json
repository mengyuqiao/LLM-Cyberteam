{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-23612", "Description": "OpenSearch is an open source distributed and RESTful search engine. OpenSearch uses JWTs to store role claims obtained from the Identity Provider (IdP) when the authentication backend is SAML or OpenID Connect. There is an issue in how those claims are processed from the JWTs where the leading and trailing whitespace is trimmed, allowing users to potentially claim roles they are not assigned to if any role matches the whitespace-stripped version of the roles they are a member of. This issue is only present for authenticated users, and it requires either the existence of roles that match, not considering leading/trailing whitespace, or the ability for users to create said matching roles. In addition, the Identity Provider must allow leading and trailing spaces in role names. OpenSearch 1.0.0-1.3.7 and 2.0.0-2.4.1 are affected. Users are advised to upgrade to OpenSearch 1.3.8 or 2.5.0. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-23612", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nAmazon\u00bbOpensearch\u00bbVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.5.0cpe:2.3:a:amazon:opensearch:*:*:*:*:*:-:*:*Matching versions\nAmazon\u00bbOpensearch\u00bbVersions  from including (>=) 1.0.0andbefore (<) 1.3.8cpe:2.3:a:amazon:opensearch:*:*:*:*:*:-:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-16  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-06  0.08%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-01-31  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-12-25  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/releases/tag/2.5.0", "ref_desc": "Release 2.5.0 \u00b7 opensearch-project/OpenSearch \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/4dh4bX84Tq3e3xpL8lSVg19TrOk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/opensearch-project/security/security/advisories/GHSA-864v-6qj7-62qj", "ref_desc": "Issue with whitespace in JWT roles \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 opensearch-project/security \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
