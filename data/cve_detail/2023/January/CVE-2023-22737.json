{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-22737", "Description": "wire-server provides back end services for Wire, a team communication and collaboration platform. Prior to version 2022-12-09, every member of a Conversation can remove a Bot from a Conversation due to a missing permissions check. Only Conversation admins should be able to remove Bots. Regular Conversations are not allowed to do so. The issue is fixed in wire-server 2022-12-09 and is already deployed on all Wire managed services. On-premise instances of wire-server need to be updated to 2022-12-09/Chart 4.29.0, so that their backends are no longer affected. There are no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-22737", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nWire\u00bbWireVersions  before (<) 2022-12-09cpe:2.3:a:wire:wire:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 45 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-17  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-09-03  0.10%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-08-19  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-02-03  0.06%  0.09%  +0.04 \n 5  2023-12-28  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.90 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-280 Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/280/Improper-Handling-of-Insufficient-Permissions-or-Privileges-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server/security/advisories/GHSA-xmjc-c6w3-pcp4", "ref_desc": "Unauthorized removal of Bots from Conversations \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 wireapp/wire-server \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server/releases/tag/v2022-12-09", "ref_desc": "Release 2022-12-09 (Chart Release 4.29.0) \u00b7 wireapp/wire-server \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server/pull/2870", "ref_desc": "[SQSERVICES-1801] Prevent dead bots in database by battermann \u00b7 Pull Request #2870 \u00b7 wireapp/wire-server \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server/commit/494a6881f5895d4ed9e5d011455242be0d5e6223", "ref_desc": "[SQSERVICES-1801] Prevent dead bots in database (#2870) \u00b7 wireapp/wire-server@494a688 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
