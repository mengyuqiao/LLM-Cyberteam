{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-0295", "Description": "The Launchpad plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via several of its settings parameters in versions up to, and including, 1.0.13 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-0295", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nObox\u00bbLaunchpad - Coming Soon & Maintenance Mode Plugin\u00bbForWordpressVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.0.13cpe:2.3:a:obox:launchpad_-_coming_soon_\\&_maintenance_mode_plugin:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-05  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-12-14  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/launchpad-by-obox/tags/1.0.13/functions/settings.php#L542", "ref_desc": "settings.php in launchpad-by-obox/tags/1.0.13/functions \u2013 WordPress Plugin RepositoryThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/b8721c4d-d89b-4e97-af01-20327013cfb6", "ref_desc": "Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
