{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-22451", "Description": "Kiwi TCMS is an open source test management system. In version 11.6 and prior, when users register new accounts and/or change passwords, there is no validation in place which would prevent them from picking an easy to guess password. This issue is resolved by providing defaults for the `AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS` configuration setting. As of version 11.7, the password can\u2019t be too similar to other personal information, must contain at least 10 characters, can\u2019t be a commonly used password, and can\u2019t be entirely numeric. As a workaround, an administrator may reset all passwords in Kiwi TCMS if they think a weak password may have been chosen.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-22451", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nKiwitcms\u00bbKiwi TcmsVersions  before (<) 11.7cpe:2.3:a:kiwitcms:kiwi_tcms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 56 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-23  0.17%  0.18%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-08-09  0.15%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-07-25  0.14%  0.15%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-06-14  0.13%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-02-04  0.11%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 6  2024-01-09  0.07%  0.11%  +0.04 \n 7  2023-12-03  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.89 \n 9  2023-01-10  0.89%  0.95%  +0.06 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-521 Weak Password Requirements", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/521/Weak-Password-Requirements.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://huntr.dev/bounties/32a873c8-f605-4aae-9272-d80985ef2b73", "ref_desc": "huntr: Page not foundPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/security/advisories/GHSA-496x-2jqf-hp7g", "ref_desc": "Weak password requirements in Kiwi TCMS \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 kiwitcms/Kiwi \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/commit/3759fb68aed36315cdde9fc573b2fe7c11544985", "ref_desc": "Update tests to use a stronger password \u00b7 kiwitcms/Kiwi@3759fb6 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
