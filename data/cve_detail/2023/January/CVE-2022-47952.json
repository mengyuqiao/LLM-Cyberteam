{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-47952", "Description": "lxc-user-nic in lxc through 5.0.1 is installed setuid root, and may allow local users to infer whether any file exists, even within a protected directory tree, because \"Failed to open\" often indicates that a file does not exist, whereas \"does not refer to a network namespace path\" often indicates that a file exists. NOTE: this is different from CVE-2018-6556 because the CVE-2018-6556 fix design was based on the premise that \"we will report back to the user that the open() failed but the user has no way of knowing why it failed\"; however, in many realistic cases, there are no plausible reasons for failing except that the file does not exist.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-47952", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLinuxcontainers\u00bbLXCVersions  up to, including, (<=) 5.0.1cpe:2.3:a:linuxcontainers:lxc:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.67%  0.04%  -1.63 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-203 Observable Discrepancy", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/203/Observable-Discrepancy.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-668 Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/668/Exposure-of-Resource-to-Wrong-Sphere.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/08/msg00025.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 3533-1] lxc security update", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/lxc/lxc/blob/0b83d71c2c8f3bac9503f894cd84584f79258bb3/lxc.spec.in#L274", "ref_desc": "lxc/lxc.spec.in at 0b83d71c2c8f3bac9503f894cd84584f79258bb3 \u00b7 lxc/lxc \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/MaherAzzouzi/CVE-2022-47952", "ref_desc": "GitHub - MaherAzzouzi/CVE-2022-47952: LXC Information Disclosure vulnerability.Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lxc/+bug/1783591/comments/45", "ref_desc": "Comment #45 : Bug #1783591 : Bugs : lxc package : UbuntuIssue Tracking;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/lxc/lxc/blob/0b83d71c2c8f3bac9503f894cd84584f79258bb3/src/lxc/cmd/lxc_user_nic.c#L1085-L1104", "ref_desc": "lxc/lxc_user_nic.c at 0b83d71c2c8f3bac9503f894cd84584f79258bb3 \u00b7 lxc/lxc \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
