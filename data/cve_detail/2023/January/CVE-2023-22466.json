{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-22466", "Description": "Tokio is a runtime for writing applications with Rust. Starting with version 1.7.0 and prior to versions 1.18.4, 1.20.3, and 1.23.1, when configuring a Windows named pipe server, setting `pipe_mode` will reset `reject_remote_clients` to `false`. If the application has previously configured `reject_remote_clients` to `true`, this effectively undoes the configuration. Remote clients may only access the named pipe if the named pipe's associated path is accessible via a publicly shared folder (SMB). Versions 1.23.1, 1.20.3, and 1.18.4 have been patched. The fix will also be present in all releases starting from version 1.24.0. Named pipes were introduced to Tokio in version 1.7.0, so releases older than 1.7.0 are not affected. As a workaround, ensure that `pipe_mode` is set first after initializing a `ServerOptions`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-22466", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nTokio\u00bbTokio\u00bbForRustVersions  from including (>=) 1.7.0andbefore (<) 1.18.4cpe:2.3:a:tokio:tokio:*:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions\nTokio\u00bbTokio\u00bbForRustVersions  from including (>=) 1.21.0andbefore (<) 1.23.1cpe:2.3:a:tokio:tokio:*:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions\nTokio\u00bbTokio\u00bbForRustVersions  from including (>=) 1.19.0andbefore (<) 1.20.3cpe:2.3:a:tokio:tokio:*:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-27  0.13%  0.12%  0.00 \n 2  2024-01-11  0.12%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-12-05  0.11%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.11%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-665 Improper Initialization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/665/Improper-Initialization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/releases/tag/tokio-1.23.1", "ref_desc": "Release Tokio v1.23.1 \u00b7 tokio-rs/tokio \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/pull/5336", "ref_desc": "net: fix named pipes server configuration builder by carllerche \u00b7 Pull Request #5336 \u00b7 tokio-rs/tokio \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/security/advisories/GHSA-7rrj-xr53-82p7", "ref_desc": "reject_remote_clients configuration may get dropped when creating a Windows named pipe \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tokio-rs/tokio \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-createnamedpipea#pipe_reject_remote_clients", "ref_desc": "CreateNamedPipeA function (winbase.h) - Win32 apps | Microsoft LearnTechnical Description;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
