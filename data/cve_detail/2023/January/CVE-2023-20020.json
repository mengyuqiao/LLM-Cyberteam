{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-20020", "Description": "A vulnerability in the Device Management Servlet application of Cisco BroadWorks Application Delivery Platform and Cisco BroadWorks Xtended Services Platform could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to improper input validation when parsing HTTP requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a sustained stream of crafted requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause all subsequent requests to be dropped, resulting in a DoS condition.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-20020", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbBroadworks Xtended Services PlatformVersions  from including (>=) 22.0andbefore (<) 23.0.1075.ap384245cpe:2.3:a:cisco:broadworks_xtended_services_platform:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbBroadworks Application Delivery Platform Device ManagementVersions  from including (>=) 22.0andbefore (<) 2022.11_1.273cpe:2.3:a:cisco:broadworks_application_delivery_platform_device_management:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-11  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-01  0.11%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-01-27  0.07%  0.11%  +0.04 \n 4  2023-12-21  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.06%  -1.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-835 Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/835/Loop-with-Unreachable-Exit-Condition-Infinite-Loop-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-bw-dos-HpkeYzp", "ref_desc": "Cisco BroadWorks Application Delivery Platform and Xtended Services Platform Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
