{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-22460", "Description": "go-ipld-prime is an implementation of the InterPlanetary Linked Data (IPLD) spec interfaces, a batteries-included codec implementations of IPLD for CBOR and JSON, and tooling for basic operations on IPLD objects. Encoding data which contains a Bytes kind Node will pass a Bytes token to the JSON encoder which will panic as it doesn't expect to receive Bytes tokens. Such an encode should be treated as an error, as plain JSON should not be able to encode Bytes. This only impacts uses of the `json` codec. `dag-json` is not impacted. Use of `json` as a decoder is not impacted. This issue is fixed in v0.19.0. As a workaround, one may prefer the `dag-json` codec, which has the ability to encode bytes.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-22460", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nProtocol\u00bbGo-ipld-prime\u00bbForGOVersions  before (<) 0.19.0cpe:2.3:a:protocol:go-ipld-prime:*:*:*:*:*:go:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 45 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-25  0.11%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-08-11  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-07-27  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 4  2024-06-16  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-04-10  0.08%  0.08%  0.00 \n 6  2024-02-06  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 7  2024-01-11  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-12-05  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.05%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/security/advisories/GHSA-c653-6hhg-9x92", "ref_desc": "\"json\" codec may panic if asked to encode bytes \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ipld/go-ipld-prime \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/pull/472", "ref_desc": "fix: correct json codec links & bytes handling by rvagg \u00b7 Pull Request #472 \u00b7 ipld/go-ipld-prime \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/releases/tag/v0.19.0", "ref_desc": "Release v0.19.0 \u00b7 ipld/go-ipld-prime \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
