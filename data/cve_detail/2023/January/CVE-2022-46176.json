{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-46176", "Description": "Cargo is a Rust package manager. The Rust Security Response WG was notified that Cargo did not perform SSH host key verification when cloning indexes and dependencies via SSH. An attacker could exploit this to perform man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2022-46176. All Rust versions containing Cargo before 1.66.1 are vulnerable. Note that even if you don't explicitly use SSH for alternate registry indexes or crate dependencies, you might be affected by this vulnerability if you have configured git to replace HTTPS connections to GitHub with SSH (through git's [`url.<base>.insteadOf`][1] setting), as that'd cause you to clone the crates.io index through SSH. Rust 1.66.1 will ensure Cargo checks the SSH host key and abort the connection if the server's public key is not already trusted. We recommend everyone to upgrade as soon as possible.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-46176", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nRust-lang\u00bbCargo\u00bbForRustVersions  up to, including, (<=) 0.67.0cpe:2.3:a:rust-lang:cargo:*:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-03  0.09%  0.09%  0.00 \n 2  2024-01-18  0.07%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-12-12  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-11-07  0.09%  0.07%  -0.03 \n 5  2023-11-06  0.05%  0.09%  +0.05 \n 6  2023-05-08  0.07%  0.05%  -0.02 \n 7  2023-04-20  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 8  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/security/advisories/GHSA-r5w3-xm58-jv6j", "ref_desc": "Cargo did not verify SSH host keys \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 rust-lang/cargo \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-security-response/tree/main/patches/CVE-2022-46176", "ref_desc": "wg-security-response/patches/CVE-2022-46176 at main \u00b7 rust-lang/wg-security-response \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/11/05/6", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Re: CVE-2022-46176: Cargo does not check SSH host keys", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
