{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-23613", "Description": "OpenSearch is an open source distributed and RESTful search engine. In affected versions there is an issue in the implementation of field-level security (FLS) and field masking where rules written to explicitly exclude fields are not correctly applied for certain queries that rely on their auto-generated .keyword fields. This issue is only present for authenticated users with read access to the indexes containing the restricted fields. This may expose data which may otherwise not be accessible to the user. OpenSearch 1.0.0-1.3.7 and 2.0.0-2.4.1 are affected. Users are advised to upgrade to OpenSearch 1.3.8 or 2.5.0. Users unable to upgrade may write explicit exclusion rules as a workaround. Policies authored in this way are not subject to this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-23613", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nAmazon\u00bbOpensearch\u00bbVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.5.0cpe:2.3:a:amazon:opensearch:*:*:*:*:*:-:*:*Matching versions\nAmazon\u00bbOpensearch\u00bbVersions  from including (>=) 1.0.0andbefore (<) 1.3.8cpe:2.3:a:amazon:opensearch:*:*:*:*:*:-:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 28 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-16  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-07-06  0.06%  0.06%  0.00 \n 3  2024-01-31  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-12-25  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/releases/tag/2.5.0", "ref_desc": "Release 2.5.0 \u00b7 opensearch-project/OpenSearch \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/4dh4bX84Tq3e3xpL8lSVg19TrOk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/opensearch-project/security/security/advisories/GHSA-v3cg-7r9h-r2g6", "ref_desc": "Field-level security issue with .keyword fields \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 opensearch-project/security \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
