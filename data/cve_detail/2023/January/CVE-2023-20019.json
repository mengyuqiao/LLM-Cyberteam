{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-20019", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco BroadWorks Application Delivery Platform, Cisco BroadWorks Application Server, and Cisco BroadWorks Xtended Services Platform could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface of an affected device.\r\n\r This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-20019", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbBroadworks Application ServerVersions  before (<) ap.as.24.0.944.ap384344cpe:2.3:a:cisco:broadworks_application_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbBroadworks Xtended Services PlatformVersions  before (<) ap.xsp.23.0.1075.ap384344cpe:2.3:a:cisco:broadworks_xtended_services_platform:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbBroadworks Application Delivery PlatformVersions  before (<) commpilot-24_2022.11cpe:2.3:a:cisco:broadworks_application_delivery_platform:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-11  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-01  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-01-27  0.07%  0.12%  +0.05 \n 4  2023-12-21  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.06%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-bw-xss-EzqDXqG4", "ref_desc": "Cisco BroadWorks Application Delivery Platform, Application Server, and Xtended Services Platform Cross-Site Scripting VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
