{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-22463", "Description": "KubePi is a k8s panel. The jwt authentication function of KubePi through version 1.6.2 uses hard-coded Jwtsigkeys, resulting in the same Jwtsigkeys for all online projects. This means that an attacker can forge any jwt token to take over the administrator account of any online project. Furthermore, they may use the administrator to take over the k8s cluster of the target enterprise. `session.go`, the use of hard-coded JwtSigKey, allows an attacker to use this value to forge jwt tokens arbitrarily. The JwtSigKey is confidential and should not be hard-coded in the code. The vulnerability has been fixed in 1.6.3. In the patch, JWT key is specified in app.yml. If the user leaves it blank, a random key will be used. There are no workarounds aside from upgrading.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-22463", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFit2cloud\u00bbKubepiVersions  before (<) 1.6.3cpe:2.3:a:fit2cloud:kubepi:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "7.40% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 94 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-08  6.17%  7.40%  +1.23 \n 2  2024-08-25  3.71%  6.17%  +2.46 \n 3  2024-08-11  3.05%  3.71%  +0.66 \n 4  2024-07-27  4.14%  3.05%  -1.09 \n 5  2024-07-14  3.62%  4.14%  +0.53 \n 6  2024-06-16  3.56%  3.62%  +0.05 \n 7  2024-06-03  1.94%  3.56%  +1.63 \n 8  2024-04-10  2.03%  1.94%  -0.10 \n 9  2024-03-02  2.18%  2.03%  -0.14 \n 10  2024-02-06  2.07%  2.18%  +0.11 \n 11  2024-01-11  1.94%  2.07%  +0.13 \n 12  2023-12-05  1.63%  1.94%  +0.30 \n 13  2023-11-24  1.78%  1.63%  -0.14 \n 14  2023-11-11  2.01%  1.78%  -0.24 \n 15  2023-11-10  4.54%  2.01%  -2.53 \n 16  2023-10-31  4.14%  4.54%  +0.41 \n 17  2023-10-08  3.20%  4.14%  +0.94 \n 18  2023-09-25  3.25%  3.20%  -0.05 \n 19  2023-09-16  0.07%  3.25%  +3.18 \n 20  2023-09-04  0.06%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 21  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.06%  -0.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/798/Use-of-Hard-coded-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/KubeOperator/KubePi/blob/da784f5532ea2495b92708cacb32703bff3a45a3/internal/api/v1/session/session.go#L35", "ref_desc": "KubePi/session.go at da784f5532ea2495b92708cacb32703bff3a45a3 \u00b7 KubeOperator/KubePi \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/KubeOperator/KubePi/security/advisories/GHSA-vjhf-8vqx-vqpq", "ref_desc": "Hardcoded Jwtsigkeys allows malicious actor to login with a forged JWT token \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 KubeOperator/KubePi \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/KubeOperator/KubePi/commit/3be58b8df5bc05d2343c30371dd5fcf6a9fbbf8b", "ref_desc": "fix: \u89e3\u51b3 jwt \u786c\u7f16\u7801\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684 k8s \u96c6\u7fa4\u63a5\u7ba1\u6f0f\u6d1e \u00b7 KubeOperator/KubePi@3be58b8 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/KubeOperator/KubePi/releases/tag/v1.6.3", "ref_desc": "Release v1.6.3 \u00b7 KubeOperator/KubePi \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
