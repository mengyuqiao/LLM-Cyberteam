{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-22461", "Description": "The `sanitize-svg` package, a small SVG sanitizer to prevent cross-site scripting attacks, uses a deny-list-pattern to sanitize SVGs to prevent XSS. In doing so, literal `<script>`-tags and on-event handlers were detected in versions prior to 0.4.0. As a result, downstream software that relies on `sanitize-svg` and expects resulting SVGs to be safe, may be vulnerable to cross-site scripting. This vulnerability was addressed in v0.4.0. There are no known workarounds", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-22461", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nSanitize-svg Project\u00bbSanitize-svg\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 0.4.0cpe:2.3:a:sanitize-svg_project:sanitize-svg:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 30 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-27  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-06-16  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-02-06  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-12-05  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-80 Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/80/Improper-Neutralization-of-Script-Related-HTML-Tags-in-a-Web.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/mattkrick/sanitize-svg/commit/b107e453ede7b58adcccae74a3e474c012eec85d", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-h857-2g56-468g \u00b7 mattkrick/sanitize-svg@b107e45 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mattkrick/sanitize-svg/security/advisories/GHSA-h857-2g56-468g", "ref_desc": "Filter Bypass Allows Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 mattkrick/sanitize-svg \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
