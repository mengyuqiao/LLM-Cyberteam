{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-22464", "Description": "ViewVC is a browser interface for CVS and Subversion version control repositories. Versions prior to 1.2.3 and 1.1.30 are vulnerable to cross-site scripting. The impact of this vulnerability is mitigated by the need for an attacker to have commit privileges to a Subversion repository exposed by an otherwise trusted ViewVC instance. The attack vector involves files with unsafe names (names that, when embedded into an HTML stream, would cause the browser to run unwanted code), which themselves can be challenging to create. Users should update to at least version 1.2.3 (if they are using a 1.2.x version of ViewVC) or 1.1.30 (if they are using a 1.1.x version). ViewVC 1.0.x is no longer supported, so users of that release lineage should implement one of the following workarounds. Users can edit their ViewVC EZT view templates to manually HTML-escape changed path \"copyfrom paths\" during rendering. Locate in your template set's `revision.ezt` file references to those changed paths, and wrap them with `[format \"html\"]` and `[end]`. For most users, that means that references to `[changes.copy_path]` will become `[format \"html\"][changes.copy_path][end]`. (This workaround should be reverted after upgrading to a patched version of ViewVC, else \"copyfrom path\" names will be doubly escaped.)", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-22464", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nViewvc\u00bbViewvcVersions  from including (>=) 1.2.0andbefore (<) 1.2.3cpe:2.3:a:viewvc:viewvc:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nViewvc\u00bbViewvcVersions  before (<) 1.1.30cpe:2.3:a:viewvc:viewvc:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-27  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-01-11  0.12%  0.09%  -0.03 \n 3  2023-12-05  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.10%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-80 Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/80/Improper-Neutralization-of-Script-Related-HTML-Tags-in-a-Web.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/viewvc/viewvc/releases/tag/1.2.3", "ref_desc": "Release ViewVC 1.2.3 \u00b7 viewvc/viewvc \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/viewvc/viewvc/releases/tag/1.1.30", "ref_desc": "Release ViewVC 1.1.30 \u00b7 viewvc/viewvc \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/viewvc/viewvc/issues/311", "ref_desc": "XSS in changed paths when reviewing revision \u00b7 Issue #311 \u00b7 viewvc/viewvc \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Mitigation;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/RZ_b9sMBQ-E13vqVuNg2xeIL9Kc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/viewvc/viewvc/security/advisories/GHSA-jvpj-293q-q53h", "ref_desc": "XSS vulnerability in revision view changed path \"copyfrom\" locations \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 viewvc/viewvc \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
