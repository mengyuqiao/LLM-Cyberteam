{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-23629", "Description": "Metabase is an open source data analytics platform. Affected versions are subject to Improper Privilege Management. As intended, recipients of dashboards subscriptions can view the data as seen by the creator of that subscription. This allows someone with greater access to data to create a dashboard subscription, add people with fewer data privileges, and all recipients of that subscription receive the same data: the charts shown in the email would abide by the privileges of the user who created the subscription. The issue is users with fewer privileges who can view a dashboard are able to add themselves to a dashboard subscription created by someone with additional data privileges, and thus get access to more data via email. This issue is patched in versions 0.43.7.1, 1.43.7.1, 0.44.6.1, 1.44.6.1, 0.45.2.1, and 1.45.2.1. On Metabase instances running Enterprise Edition, admins can disable the \"Subscriptions and Alerts\" permission for groups that have restricted data permissions, as a workaround.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-23629", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nMetabase\u00bbMetabaseVersions  from including (>=) 1.44.0andbefore (<) 1.44.6.1cpe:2.3:a:metabase:metabase:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMetabase\u00bbMetabaseVersions  from including (>=) 1.45.0andbefore (<) 1.45.2.1cpe:2.3:a:metabase:metabase:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMetabase\u00bbMetabaseVersions  from including (>=) 1.0.0andbefore (<) 1.43.7.1cpe:2.3:a:metabase:metabase:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMetabase\u00bbMetabaseVersions  before (<) 0.43.7.1cpe:2.3:a:metabase:metabase:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMetabase\u00bbMetabaseVersions  from including (>=) 0.45.0andbefore (<) 0.45.2.1cpe:2.3:a:metabase:metabase:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMetabase\u00bbMetabaseVersions  from including (>=) 0.44.0andbefore (<) 0.44.6.1cpe:2.3:a:metabase:metabase:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-20  0.06%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-07-10  0.06%  0.06%  0.00 \n 3  2024-02-03  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-12-28  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/metabase/metabase/security/advisories/GHSA-ch8f-hhq9-7gv5", "ref_desc": "Users can view data they don't have privileges to view by adding themselves to dashboard subscriptions created by users with more data privileges \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 metabase/metabase \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
