{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-23609", "Description": "Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for Next-Generation IoT devices. Versions prior to and including 4.8 are vulnerable to an out-of-bounds write that can occur in the BLE-L2CAP module. The Bluetooth Low Energy - Logical Link Control and Adaptation Layer Protocol (BLE-L2CAP) module handles fragmentation of packets up the configured MTU size. When fragments are reassembled, they are stored in a packet buffer of a configurable size, but there is no check to verify that the packet buffer is large enough to hold the reassembled packet. In Contiki-NG's default configuration, it is possible that an out-of-bounds write of up to 1152 bytes occurs. The vulnerability has been patched in the \"develop\" branch of Contiki-NG, and will be included in release 4.9. The problem can be fixed by applying the patch in Contiki-NG pull request #2254 prior to the release of version 4.9.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-23609", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nContiki-ng\u00bbContiki-ngVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.8cpe:2.3:o:contiki-ng:contiki-ng:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 22 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-07  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-02-27  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/security/advisories/GHSA-qr4q-6h3m-h3g7", "ref_desc": "Improper size validation of L2CAP frames \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 contiki-ng/contiki-ng \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/2254", "ref_desc": "Check available packetbuf space before writing to it in ble-l2cap by nvt \u00b7 Pull Request #2254 \u00b7 contiki-ng/contiki-ng \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
