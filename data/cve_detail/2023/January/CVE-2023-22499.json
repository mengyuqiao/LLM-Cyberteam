{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-22499", "Description": "Deno is a runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that uses V8 and is built in Rust. Multi-threaded programs were able to spoof interactive permission prompt by rewriting the prompt to suggest that program is waiting on user confirmation to unrelated action. A malicious program could clear the terminal screen after permission prompt was shown and write a generic message. This situation impacts users who use Web Worker API and relied on interactive permission prompt. The reproduction is very timing sensitive and can\u2019t be reliably reproduced on every try. This problem can not be exploited on systems that do not attach an interactive prompt (for example headless servers). The problem has been fixed in Deno v1.29.3; it is recommended all users update to this version. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may run with --no-prompt flag to disable interactive permission prompts.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-22499", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDeno\u00bbDenoVersions  from including (>=) 1.9.0andbefore (<) 1.29.3cpe:2.3:a:deno:deno:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 57 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-09  0.17%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-06-29  0.16%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-02-19  0.14%  0.16%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-01-24  0.10%  0.14%  +0.04 \n 5  2023-12-18  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-362 Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/362/Concurrent-Execution-using-Shared-Resource-with-Improper-Syn.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/denoland/deno/security/advisories/GHSA-mc52-jpm2-cqh6", "ref_desc": "Interactive permission prompt spoofing \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 denoland/deno \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/17392", "ref_desc": "fix(permissions): lock stdio streams when prompt is shown by bartlomieju \u00b7 Pull Request #17392 \u00b7 denoland/deno \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
