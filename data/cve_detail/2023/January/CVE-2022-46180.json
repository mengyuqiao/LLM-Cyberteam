{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-46180", "Description": "Discourse Mermaid (discourse-mermaid-theme-component) allows users of Discourse, open-source forum software, to create graphs using the Mermaid syntax. Users of discourse-mermaid-theme-component version 1.0.0 who can create posts are able to inject arbitrary HTML on that post. The issue has been fixed on the `main` branch of the GitHub repository, with 1.1.0 named as a patched version. Admins can update the theme component through the admin UI. As a workaround, admins can temporarily disable discourse-mermaid-theme-component.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-46180", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nDiscourse\u00bbMermaidVersions  from including (>=) 1.0.0andbefore (<) 1.1.0cpe:2.3:a:discourse:mermaid:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 23 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-01-11  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-12-05  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse-mermaid-theme-component/security/advisories/GHSA-8437-hgcm-p3q3", "ref_desc": "Arbitrary HTML injection in discourse-mermaid-theme-component \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 discourse/discourse-mermaid-theme-component \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse-mermaid-theme-component/commit/c10bc4a08bf865cee20e5d5dffba535762813f0f", "ref_desc": "SECURITY: render errors as plain text (#14) \u00b7 discourse/discourse-mermaid-theme-component@c10bc4a \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse-mermaid-theme-component/pull/14", "ref_desc": "SECURITY: render errors as plain text by jjaffeux \u00b7 Pull Request #14 \u00b7 discourse/discourse-mermaid-theme-component \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
