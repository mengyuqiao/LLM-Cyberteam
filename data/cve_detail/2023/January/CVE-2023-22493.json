{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-22493", "Description": "RSSHub is an open source RSS feed generator. RSSHub is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. This vulnerability allows an attacker to send arbitrary HTTP requests from the server to other servers or resources on the network. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a request to the affected routes with a malicious URL. An attacker could also use this vulnerability to send requests to internal or any other servers or resources on the network, potentially gain access to sensitive information that would not normally be accessible and amplifying the impact of the attack. The patch for this issue can be found in commit a66cbcf.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-22493", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nRsshub\u00bbRsshub\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 2023-01-10cpe:2.3:a:rsshub:rsshub:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-05  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-06-25  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-02-15  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-01-20  0.07%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-12-14  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/pull/11588", "ref_desc": "feat(config)!: unsafe domain toggle by TonyRL \u00b7 Pull Request #11588 \u00b7 DIYgod/RSSHub \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/commit/a66cbcf6eebc700bf97ab097f404f16ab415506a", "ref_desc": "feat(config)!: unsafe domain toggle (#11588) \u00b7 DIYgod/RSSHub@a66cbcf \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/security/advisories/GHSA-64wp-jh9p-5cg2", "ref_desc": "SSRF vulnerability \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 DIYgod/RSSHub \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
