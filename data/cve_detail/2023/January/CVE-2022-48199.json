{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-48199", "Description": "SoftPerfect NetWorx 7.1.1 on Windows allows an attacker to execute a malicious binary with potentially higher privileges via a low-privileged user account that abuses the Notifications function. The Notifications function allows for arbitrary binary execution and can be modified by any user. The resulting binary execution will occur in the context of any user running NetWorx. If an attacker modifies the Notifications function to execute a malicious binary, the binary will be executed by every user running NetWorx on that system.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-48199", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSoftperfect\u00bbNetworx\u00bbVersion:7.1.1cpe:2.3:a:softperfect:networx:7.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-06  0.12%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-01-31  0.08%  0.12%  +0.04 \n 3  2023-12-25  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-12-01  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.44%  0.06%  -1.39 \n 6  2023-02-07  2.49%  1.44%  -1.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.softperfect.com/products/changelog.php?product_id=2", "ref_desc": "SoftPerfect NetWorx ChangelogRelease Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://giuliamelottigaribaldi.com/cve-2022-48199/", "ref_desc": "cve-2022-48199Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
