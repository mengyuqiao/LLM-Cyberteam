{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-20007", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV340, RV340W, RV345, and RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause the web-based management process on the device to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The attacker must have valid administrator credentials. \r\n\r This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input to the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP input to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on the underlying operating system or cause the web-based management process to restart, resulting in a DoS condition.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-20007", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Execute code;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbRv340 FirmwareVersions  before (<) 1.0.03.29cpe:2.3:o:cisco:rv340_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv340\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbRv340w FirmwareVersions  before (<) 1.0.03.29cpe:2.3:o:cisco:rv340w_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv340w\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbRv345 FirmwareVersions  before (<) 1.0.03.29cpe:2.3:o:cisco:rv345_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv345\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbRv345p FirmwareVersions  before (<) 1.0.03.29cpe:2.3:o:cisco:rv345p_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv345p\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-26  0.15%  0.16%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-08-11  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-01-27  0.08%  0.14%  +0.06 \n 4  2023-12-21  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-11-27  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.16%  0.06%  -1.09 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/120/Buffer-Copy-without-Checking-Size-of-Input-Classic-Buffer-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sb-rv-rcedos-7HjP74jD", "ref_desc": "Cisco RV340, RV340W, RV345, and RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers Remote Code Execution and Denial of Service VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
