{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-22947", "Description": "Insecure folder permissions in the Windows installation path of Shibboleth Service Provider (SP) before 3.4.1 allow an unprivileged local attacker to escalate privileges to SYSTEM via DLL planting in the service executable's folder. This occurs because the installation goes under C:\\opt (rather than C:\\Program Files) by default. NOTE: the vendor disputes the significance of this report, stating that \"We consider the ACLs a best effort thing\" and \"it was a documentation mistake.\"", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-22947", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nShibboleth\u00bbService ProviderVersions  before (<) 3.4.1cpe:2.3:a:shibboleth:service_provider:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 7 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-427 Uncontrolled Search Path Element", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/427/Uncontrolled-Search-Path-Element.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://shibboleth.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SP3/pages/2065335545/Install+on+Windows#Restricting-ACLs", "ref_desc": "Install on Windows - Service Provider 3 - ConfluenceThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://shibboleth.atlassian.net/browse/SSPCPP-961", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
