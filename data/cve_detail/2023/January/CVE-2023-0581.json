{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-0581", "Description": "The PrivateContent plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to protection mechanism bypass due to the use of client side validation in versions up to, and including, 8.4.3. This is due to the plugin checking if an IP had been blocklist via client-side scripts rather than server-side. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass any login restrictions that may prevent a brute force attack.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-0581", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nLcweb\u00bbPrivatecontent\u00bbForWordpressVersions  before (<) 8.4.4cpe:2.3:a:lcweb:privatecontent:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 34 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-12  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-03-03  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-02-06  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-12-31  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-602 Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/602/Client-Side-Enforcement-of-Server-Side-Security.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/de73304e-7a28-4304-b1ed-2f6dd7738236", "ref_desc": "Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lcweb.it/privatecontent/changelog", "ref_desc": "PrivateContent \u2013 Changelog | LCwebRelease Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
