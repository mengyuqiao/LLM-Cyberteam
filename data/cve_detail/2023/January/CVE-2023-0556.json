{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-0556", "Description": "The ContentStudio plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on several functions in versions up to, and including, 1.2.5. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to obtain the blog metadata (via the function cstu_get_metadata) that includes the plugin's contentstudio_token. Knowing this token allows for other interactions with the plugin such as creating posts in versions prior to 1.2.5, which added other requirements to posting and updating.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-0556", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nContentstudio\u00bbContentstudio\u00bbForWordpressVersions  before (<) 1.2.6cpe:2.3:a:contentstudio:contentstudio:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-19  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-09  0.09%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-02-29  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-02-03  0.07%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-12-28  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-08-12  0.09%  0.06%  -0.03 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.09%  -0.87 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/52db8d41-859a-4d68-8b83-3d3af8f1bf64", "ref_desc": "Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&new=2851006%40contentstudio%2Ftrunk&old=2844028%40contentstudio%2Ftrunk&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=", "ref_desc": "Patch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/cpuRbIy-bgSCrbY3A7IWkhMmJcs.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/contentstudio/tags/1.2.1/contentstudio-plugin.php#L517", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
