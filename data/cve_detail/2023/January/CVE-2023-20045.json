{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-20045", "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV160 and RV260 Series VPN Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of an affected device.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the web-based management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands using root-level privileges on the affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid Administrator-level credentials on the affected device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-20045", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbRv160w Wireless-ac Vpn Router FirmwareVersions  before (<) 1.0.01.04cpe:2.3:o:cisco:rv160w_wireless-ac_vpn_router_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv160w Wireless-ac Vpn Router\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbRv260 Vpn Router FirmwareVersions  before (<) 1.0.01.04cpe:2.3:o:cisco:rv260_vpn_router_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv260 Vpn Router\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbRv260p Vpn Router With Poe FirmwareVersions  before (<) 1.0.01.04cpe:2.3:o:cisco:rv260p_vpn_router_with_poe_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv260p Vpn Router With Poe\u00bbVersion:N/A\nCisco\u00bbRv160 Vpn Router FirmwareVersions  before (<) 1.0.01.04cpe:2.3:o:cisco:rv160_vpn_router_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Cisco\u00bbRv160 Vpn Router\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 45 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-26  0.11%  0.11%  0.00 \n 2  2024-08-11  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-01-27  0.07%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-01-26  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-12-21  0.08%  0.07%  -0.01 \n 6  2023-11-27  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.08%  -0.97 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-rv-cmd-exe-n47kJQLE", "ref_desc": "Cisco Small Business RV160 and RV260 Series VPN Routers Remote Command Execution VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
