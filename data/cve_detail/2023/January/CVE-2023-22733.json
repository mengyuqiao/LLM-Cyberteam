{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-22733", "Description": "Shopware is an open source commerce platform based on Symfony Framework and Vue js. In affected versions the log module would write out all kind of sent mails. An attacker with access to either the local system logs or a centralized logging store may have access to other users accounts. This issue has been addressed in version 6.4.18.1. For older versions of 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3, corresponding security measures are also available via a plugin. For the full range of functions, we recommend updating to the latest Shopware version. Users unable to upgrade may remove from all users the log module ACL rights or disable logging.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-22733", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nShopware\u00bbShopwareVersions  before (<) 6.4.18.1cpe:2.3:a:shopware:shopware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-09  0.10%  0.10%  0.00 \n 2  2024-01-24  0.08%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-12-18  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.07%  -0.88 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-532 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/532/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-into-Log-File.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/shopware/platform/security/advisories/GHSA-7cp7-jfp6-jh4f", "ref_desc": "Improper Output Neutralization in Log Module \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 shopware/platform \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.shopware.com/en/shopware-6-en/security-updates/security-update-01-2023?category=security-updates", "ref_desc": "Shopware 6 - Security Updates - Security Update 01/2023Patch;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/BofbeSif3s7QgAKGtk1UZ7RevNk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/hosting/performance/performance-tweaks#logging", "ref_desc": "Performance Tweaks - Shopware DeveloperVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/shopware/platform/commit/407a83063d7141c1a626441799c3ebef79498c07", "ref_desc": "NEXT-24679 - Fix hiding reset password of mail in log \u00b7 shopware/platform@407a830 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
