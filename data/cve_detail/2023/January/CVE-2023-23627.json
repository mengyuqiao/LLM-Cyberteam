{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-23627", "Description": "Sanitize is an allowlist-based HTML and CSS sanitizer. Versions 5.0.0 and later, prior to 6.0.1, are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting. When Sanitize is configured with a custom allowlist that allows `noscript` elements, attackers are able to include arbitrary HTML, resulting in XSS (cross-site scripting) or other undesired behavior when that HTML is rendered in a browser. The default configurations do not allow `noscript` elements and are not vulnerable. This issue only affects users who are using a custom config that adds `noscript` to the element allowlist. This issue has been patched in version 6.0.1. Users who are unable to upgrade can prevent this issue by using one of Sanitize's default configs or by ensuring that their custom config does not include `noscript` in the element allowlist.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-23627", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nSanitize Project\u00bbSanitize\u00bbForRubyVersions  from including (>=) 5.0.0andbefore (<) 6.0.1cpe:2.3:a:sanitize_project:sanitize:*:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 32 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-19  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-07-09  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-02-03  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-12-28  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/rgrove/sanitize/security/advisories/GHSA-fw3g-2h3j-qmm7", "ref_desc": "Improper neutralization of `noscript` element content may allow XSS in Sanitize \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 rgrove/sanitize \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Release Notes;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
