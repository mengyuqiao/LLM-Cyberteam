{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-22731", "Description": "Shopware is an open source commerce platform based on Symfony Framework and Vue js. In a Twig environment **without the Sandbox extension**, it is possible to refer to PHP functions in twig filters like `map`, `filter`, `sort`. This allows a template to call any global PHP function and thus execute arbitrary code. The attacker must have access to a Twig environment in order to exploit this vulnerability. This problem has been fixed with 6.4.18.1 with an override of the specified filters until the integration of the Sandbox extension has been finished. Users are advised to upgrade. Users of major versions 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 may also receive this fix via a plugin.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-22731", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nShopware\u00bbShopwareVersions  before (<) 6.4.18.1cpe:2.3:a:shopware:shopware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.30% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 70 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-05  0.28%  0.30%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-10-06  0.28%  0.28%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-09-07  0.20%  0.28%  +0.08 \n 4  2024-08-24  0.19%  0.20%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-08-09  0.19%  0.19%  +0.00 \n 6  2024-06-29  0.18%  0.19%  +0.01 \n 7  2024-01-24  0.10%  0.18%  +0.08 \n 8  2023-12-18  0.08%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 9  2023-11-24  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 10  2023-03-07  2.20%  0.07%  -2.13 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://docs.shopware.com/en/shopware-6-en/security-updates/security-update-01-2023?category=security-updates", "ref_desc": "Shopware 6 - Security Updates - Security Update 01/2023Patch;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/BofbeSif3s7QgAKGtk1UZ7RevNk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/shopware/platform/security/advisories/GHSA-93cw-f5jj-x85w", "ref_desc": "Improper Control of Generation of Code in Twig rendered views \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 shopware/platform \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/shopware/platform/commit/89d1ea154689cb6202e0d3a0ceeae0febb0c09e1", "ref_desc": "NEXT-24667 - Add twig improvements \u00b7 shopware/platform@89d1ea1 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
