{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-0040", "Description": "Versions of Async HTTP Client prior to 1.13.2 are vulnerable to a form of targeted request manipulation called CRLF injection. This vulnerability was the result of insufficient validation of HTTP header field values before sending them to the network. Users are vulnerable if they pass untrusted data into HTTP header field values without prior sanitisation. Common use-cases here might be to place usernames from a database into HTTP header fields. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject new HTTP header fields, or entirely new requests, into the data stream. This can cause requests to be understood very differently by the remote server than was intended. In general, this is unlikely to result in data disclosure, but it can result in a number of logical errors and other misbehaviours.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-0040", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAsynchttpclient Project\u00bbAsync-http-clientVersions  from including (>=) 1.10.0andbefore (<) 1.12.1cpe:2.3:a:asynchttpclient_project:async-http-client:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAsynchttpclient Project\u00bbAsync-http-clientVersions  from including (>=) 1.5.0andbefore (<) 1.9.1cpe:2.3:a:asynchttpclient_project:async-http-client:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAsynchttpclient Project\u00bbAsync-http-clientVersions  before (<) 1.4.1cpe:2.3:a:asynchttpclient_project:async-http-client:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAsynchttpclient Project\u00bbAsync-http-clientVersions  from including (>=) 1.13.0andbefore (<) 1.13.2cpe:2.3:a:asynchttpclient_project:async-http-client:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 30 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-30  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-01-25  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-12-19  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-93 Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/93/Improper-Neutralization-of-CRLF-Sequences-CRLF-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/swift-server/async-http-client/security/advisories/GHSA-v3r5-pjpm-mwgq", "ref_desc": "CRLF Injection in HTTP request headers \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 swift-server/async-http-client \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
