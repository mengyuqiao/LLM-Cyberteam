{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-23611", "Description": "LTI Consumer XBlock implements the consumer side of the LTI specification enabling integration of third-party LTI provider tools. Versions 7.0.0 and above, prior to 7.2.2, are vulnerable to Missing Authorization. Any LTI tool that is integrated with on the Open edX platform can post a grade back for any LTI XBlock so long as it knows or can guess the block location for that XBlock. An LTI tool submits scores to the edX platform for line items. The code that uploads that score to the LMS grade tables determines which XBlock to upload the grades for by reading the resource_link_id field of the associated line item. The LTI tool may submit any value for the resource_link_id field, allowing a malicious LTI tool to submit scores for any LTI XBlock on the platform. The impact is a loss of integrity for LTI XBlock grades. This issue is patched in 7.2.2. No workarounds exist.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-23611", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOpenedx\u00bbXblock-lti-consumerVersions  from including (>=) 7.0.0andbefore (<) 7.2.2cpe:2.3:a:openedx:xblock-lti-consumer:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 23 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-17  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-02-01  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-12-26  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/openedx/xblock-lti-consumer/security/advisories/GHSA-7j9p-67mm-5g87", "ref_desc": "Vulnerability in LTI 1.3 Grade Pass Back Implementation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 openedx/xblock-lti-consumer \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
