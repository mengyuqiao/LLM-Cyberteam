{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-22482", "Description": "Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Versions of Argo CD starting with v1.8.2 and prior to 2.3.13, 2.4.19, 2.5.6, and 2.6.0-rc-3  are vulnerable to an improper authorization bug causing the API to accept certain invalid tokens. OIDC providers include an `aud` (audience) claim in signed tokens. The value of that claim specifies the intended audience(s) of the token (i.e. the service or services which are meant to accept the token). Argo CD _does_ validate that the token was signed by Argo CD's configured OIDC provider. But Argo CD _does not_ validate the audience claim, so it will accept tokens that are not intended for Argo CD. If Argo CD's configured OIDC provider also serves other audiences (for example, a file storage service), then Argo CD will accept a token intended for one of those other audiences. Argo CD will grant the user privileges based on the token's `groups` claim, even though those groups were not intended to be used by Argo CD. This bug also increases the impact of a stolen token. If an attacker steals a valid token for a different audience, they can use it to access Argo CD. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in versions 2.6.0-rc3, 2.5.6, 2.4.19, and 2.3.13. There are no workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-22482", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nArgoproj\u00bbArgo CdVersions  from including (>=) 1.8.2andbefore (<) 2.3.14cpe:2.3:a:argoproj:argo_cd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nArgoproj\u00bbArgo CdVersions  from including (>=) 2.4.0andbefore (<) 2.4.20cpe:2.3:a:argoproj:argo_cd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nArgoproj\u00bbArgo CdVersions  from including (>=) 2.5.0andbefore (<) 2.5.8cpe:2.3:a:argoproj:argo_cd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nArgoproj\u00bbArgo Cd\u00bbVersion:2.6.0UpdateRC1cpe:2.3:a:argoproj:argo_cd:2.6.0:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nArgoproj\u00bbArgo Cd\u00bbVersion:2.6.0UpdateRC2cpe:2.3:a:argoproj:argo_cd:2.6.0:rc2:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nArgoproj\u00bbArgo Cd\u00bbVersion:2.6.0UpdateRC3cpe:2.3:a:argoproj:argo_cd:2.6.0:rc3:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nArgoproj\u00bbArgo Cd\u00bbVersion:2.6.0UpdateRC4cpe:2.3:a:argoproj:argo_cd:2.6.0:rc4:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-17  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-07  0.09%  0.09%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-02-01  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-12-26  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-05-08  0.14%  0.05%  -0.09 \n 6  2023-05-04  0.07%  0.14%  +0.07 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/advisories/GHSA-q9hr-j4rf-8fjc", "ref_desc": "JWT audience claim is not verified \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 argoproj/argo-cd \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
