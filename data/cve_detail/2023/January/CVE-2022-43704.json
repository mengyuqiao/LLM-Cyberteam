{"CVE Code": "CVE-2022-43704", "Description": "The Sinilink XY-WFT1 WiFi Remote Thermostat, running firmware 1.3.6, allows an attacker to bypass the intended requirement to communicate using MQTT. It is possible to replay Sinilink aka SINILINK521 protocol (udp/1024) commands interfacing directly with the target device. This, in turn, allows for an attack to control the onboard relay without requiring authentication via the mobile application. This might result in an unacceptable temperature within the target device's physical environment.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-43704", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSinilink\u00bbXy-wft1 Firmware\u00bbVersion:1.3.6cpe:2.3:o:sinilink:xy-wft1_firmware:1.3.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Sinilink\u00bbXy-wft1\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 34 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-12  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-07-02  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-01-27  0.05%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-12-21  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 5  2023-05-08  0.06%  0.05%  -0.01 \n 6  2023-04-29  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-294 Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/294/Authentication-Bypass-by-Capture-replay.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/cve-2022-43704-capture-replay-vulnerability-in-sinilink-xy-wft1-thermostat/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2022-43704 - Capture-Replay Vulnerability in Sinilink XY-WFT1 Thermostat | TrustwaveExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
