{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-20040", "Description": "A vulnerability in the NETCONF service of Cisco Network Services Orchestrator (NSO) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) on an affected system that is running as the root user. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must be a member of the admin group.\r\n\r This vulnerability exists because user-supplied input is not properly validated when NETCONF is used to upload packages to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a specially crafted package file. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to write crafted files to arbitrary locations on the filesystem or delete arbitrary files from the filesystem of an affected device, resulting in a DoS condition. \r\n\r Note: By default, during install, Cisco NSO will be set up to run as the root user unless the --run-as-user option is used.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-20040", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbNetwork Services OrchestratorVersions  from including (>=) 5.7andbefore (<) 5.7.4cpe:2.3:a:cisco:network_services_orchestrator:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbNetwork Services OrchestratorVersions  from including (>=) 3.3andbefore (<) 5.4.7cpe:2.3:a:cisco:network_services_orchestrator:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbNetwork Services OrchestratorVersions  from including (>=) 5.6andbefore (<) 5.6.7cpe:2.3:a:cisco:network_services_orchestrator:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbNetwork Services OrchestratorVersions  from including (>=) 5.5andbefore (<) 5.5.6cpe:2.3:a:cisco:network_services_orchestrator:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbNetwork Services Orchestrator\u00bbVersion:5.8cpe:2.3:a:cisco:network_services_orchestrator:5.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 45 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-11  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-01-27  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 3  2023-12-21  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.05%  -1.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-23 Relative Path Traversal", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/23/Relative-Path-Traversal.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-nso-path-trvsl-zjBeMkZg", "ref_desc": "Cisco Network Services Orchestrator Path Traversal VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
