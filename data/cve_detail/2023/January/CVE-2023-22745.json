{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-22745", "Description": "tpm2-tss is an open source software implementation of the Trusted Computing Group (TCG) Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2 Software Stack (TSS2). In affected versions `Tss2_RC_SetHandler` and `Tss2_RC_Decode` both index into `layer_handler` with an 8 bit layer number, but the array only has `TPM2_ERROR_TSS2_RC_LAYER_COUNT` entries, so trying to add a handler for higher-numbered layers or decode a response code with such a layer number reads/writes past the end of the buffer. This Buffer overrun, could result in arbitrary code execution. An example attack would be a MiTM bus attack that returns 0xFFFFFFFF for the RC. Given the common use case of TPM modules an attacker must have local access to the target machine with local system privileges which allows access to the TPM system. Usually TPM access requires administrative privilege.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-22745", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nTpm2 Software Stack Project\u00bbTpm2 Software StackVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.0.0cpe:2.3:a:tpm2_software_stack_project:tpm2_software_stack:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-11  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.01%  0.04%  -0.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/120/Buffer-Copy-without-Checking-Size-of-Input-Classic-Buffer-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tss/commit/306490c8d848c367faa2d9df81f5e69dab46ffb5", "ref_desc": "tss2_rc: ensure layer number is in bounds \u00b7 tpm2-software/tpm2-tss@306490c \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tss/security/advisories/GHSA-4j3v-fh23-vx67", "ref_desc": "Buffer Overlow in TSS2_RC_Decode \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tpm2-software/tpm2-tss \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
