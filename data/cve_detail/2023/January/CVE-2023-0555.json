{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-0555", "Description": "The Quick Restaurant Menu plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on its AJAX actions in versions up to, and including, 2.0.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to invoke those actions intended for administrator use. Actions include menu item creation, update and deletion and other menu management functions. Since the plugin does not verify that a post ID passed to one of its AJAX actions belongs to a menu item, this can lead to arbitrary post deletion/alteration.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-0555", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nThingsforrestaurants\u00bbQuick Restaurant Menu\u00bbForWordpressVersions  before (<) 2.1.0cpe:2.3:a:thingsforrestaurants:quick_restaurant_menu:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-19  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-02-03  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-12-28  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2851871/quick-restaurant-menu/trunk?contextall=1&old=2788636&old_path=%2Fquick-restaurant-menu%2Ftrunk", "ref_desc": "Patch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/EzdusOhaBiTiPaNpoD-UjN8azJQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/quick-restaurant-menu/tags/2.0.2/includes/admin/ajax-functions.php", "ref_desc": "Release Notes;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Wi-XaLImOz2U_BYiyYkB6JizWBo.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/97984c7d-d6ff-480c-acfe-20ab0eb04141", "ref_desc": "Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
