{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-0087", "Description": "The Swifty Page Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the \u2018spm_plugin_options_page_tree_max_width\u2019 parameter in versions up to, and including, 3.0.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-0087", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nSwifty Page Manager Project\u00bbSwifty Page Manager\u00bbForWordpressVersions  up to, including, (<=) 3.0.1cpe:2.3:a:swifty_page_manager_project:swifty_page_manager:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 22 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-07-28  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-12-06  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/8550a405-9fa2-41a3-b556-05ff9f577ce4", "ref_desc": "Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/swifty-page-manager/trunk/view/page_tree.php?rev=1555394#L174", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
