{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-46138", "Description": "JumpServer is an open source bastion host and maintenance security audit system that complies with 4A specifications. Prior to version 3.8.0, the default email for initial user admin is `admin[@]mycompany[.]com`, and users reset their passwords by sending an email. Currently, the domain `mycompany.com` has not been registered. However, if it is registered in the future, it may affect the password reset functionality. This issue has been patched in version 3.8.0 by changing the default email domain to `example.com`. Those who cannot upgrade may change the default email domain to `example.com` manually.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46138", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFit2cloud\u00bbJumpserverVersions  before (<) 3.8.0cpe:2.3:a:fit2cloud:jumpserver:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 32 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-02  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-11-05  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-09-29  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-11-09  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-640 Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/640/Weak-Password-Recovery-Mechanism-for-Forgotten-Password.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/jumpserver/jumpserver/commit/15a5dda9e0cdbe2ac618a6b2a09df8928f485c88", "ref_desc": "perf: \u4fee\u6539\u9ed8\u8ba4\u7684\u90ae\u7bb1\u5730\u5740 \u00b7 jumpserver/jumpserver@15a5dda \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/jumpserver/jumpserver/security/advisories/GHSA-9mrc-75cv-46cq", "ref_desc": "Default admin user email leak to password reset \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 jumpserver/jumpserver \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
