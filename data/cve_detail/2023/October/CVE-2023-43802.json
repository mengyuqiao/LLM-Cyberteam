{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-43802", "Description": "Arduino Create Agent is a package to help manage Arduino development. This vulnerability affects the endpoint `/upload` which handles request with the `filename` parameter. A user who has the ability to perform HTTP requests to the localhost interface, or is able to bypass the CORS configuration, can escalate their privileges to those of the user running the Arduino Create Agent service via a crafted HTTP POST request. This issue has been addressed in version `1.3.3`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-43802", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nArduino\u00bbCreate Agent\u00bbForGOVersions  before (<) 1.3.3cpe:2.3:a:arduino:create_agent:*:*:*:*:*:go:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 24 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-11-03  0.06%  0.06%  0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.nozominetworks.com/blog/security-flaws-affect-a-component-of-the-arduino-create-cloud-ide", "ref_desc": "New Vulnerabilities in Arduino Software Allow Privilege EscalationCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/eBbDmal-6FoWnYP4OzU5WuCp8k0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/arduino/arduino-create-agent/security/advisories/GHSA-75j7-w798-cwwx", "ref_desc": "Path traversal - local privilege escalation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 arduino/arduino-create-agent \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/arduino/arduino-create-agent/releases/tag/1.3.3", "ref_desc": "Release 1.3.3 \u00b7 arduino/arduino-create-agent \u00b7 GitHubCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/jx32rW9WDT3MKpYBxkblyCgn20U.html"}]}
