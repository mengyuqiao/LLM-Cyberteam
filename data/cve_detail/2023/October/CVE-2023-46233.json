{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-46233", "Description": "crypto-js is a JavaScript library of crypto standards. Prior to version 4.2.0, crypto-js PBKDF2 is 1,000 times weaker than originally specified in 1993, and at least 1,300,000 times weaker than current industry standard. This is because it both defaults to SHA1, a cryptographic hash algorithm considered insecure since at least 2005, and defaults to one single iteration, a 'strength' or 'difficulty' value specified at 1,000 when specified in 1993. PBKDF2 relies on iteration count as a countermeasure to preimage and collision attacks. If used to protect passwords, the impact is high. If used to generate signatures, the impact is high. Version 4.2.0 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, configure crypto-js to use SHA256 with at least 250,000 iterations.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46233", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCrypto-js Project\u00bbCrypto-jsVersions  before (<) 4.2.0cpe:2.3:a:crypto-js_project:crypto-js:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-26  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-31  0.07%  0.12%  +0.05 \n 3  2024-09-24  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-11-28  0.09%  0.07%  -0.02 \n 5  2023-11-07  0.04%  0.09%  +0.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-327 Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/327/Use-of-a-Broken-or-Risky-Cryptographic-Algorithm.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-328 Use of Weak Hash", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/328/Use-of-Weak-Hash.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-916 Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/916/Use-of-Password-Hash-With-Insufficient-Computational-Effort.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/brix/crypto-js/security/advisories/GHSA-xwcq-pm8m-c4vf", "ref_desc": "crypto-js PBKDF2 1,000 times weaker than specified in 1993 and 1.3M times weaker than current standard \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 brix/crypto-js \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/11/msg00025.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 3669-1] cryptojs security update", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/brix/crypto-js/commit/421dd538b2d34e7c24a5b72cc64dc2b9167db40a", "ref_desc": "Change default hash algorithm and iteration's for PBKDF2 to prevent w\u2026 \u00b7 brix/crypto-js@421dd53 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
