{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-45810", "Description": "OpenFGA is a flexible authorization/permission engine built for developers and inspired by Google Zanzibar. Affected versions of OpenFGA are vulnerable to a denial of service attack. When a number of `ListObjects` calls are executed, in some scenarios, those calls are not releasing resources even after a response has been sent, and given a sufficient call volume the service as a whole becomes unresponsive. This issue has been addressed in version 1.3.4 and the upgrade is considered backwards compatible. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45810", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nOpenfga\u00bbOpenfgaVersions  before (<) 1.3.4cpe:2.3:a:openfga:openfga:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 35 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-23  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-09-16  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-10-26  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/openfga/openfga/security/advisories/GHSA-hr4f-6jh8-f2vq", "ref_desc": "OpenFGA DoS \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 openfga/openfga \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
