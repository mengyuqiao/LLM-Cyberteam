{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-45826", "Description": "Leantime is an open source project management system. A 'userId' variable in `app/domain/files/repositories/class.files.php` is not parameterized. An authenticated attacker can send a carefully crafted POST request to `/api/jsonrpc` to exploit an SQL injection vulnerability. Confidentiality is impacted as it allows for dumping information from the database. This issue has been addressed in version 2.4-beta-4. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45826", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nLeantime\u00bbLeantimeVersions  before (<) 2.4cpe:2.3:a:leantime:leantime:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLeantime\u00bbLeantime\u00bbVersion:2.4cpe:2.3:a:leantime:leantime:2.4:-:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLeantime\u00bbLeantime\u00bbVersion:2.4UpdateBetacpe:2.3:a:leantime:leantime:2.4:beta:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLeantime\u00bbLeantime\u00bbVersion:2.4UpdateBeta2cpe:2.3:a:leantime:leantime:2.4:beta2:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nLeantime\u00bbLeantime\u00bbVersion:2.4UpdateBeta3cpe:2.3:a:leantime:leantime:2.4:beta3:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-25  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-09-18  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-10-28  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Leantime/leantime/commit/be75f1e0f311d11c00a0bdc7079a62eef3594bf0", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #1906 from Leantime/bugFixes \u00b7 Leantime/leantime@be75f1e \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Leantime/leantime/security/advisories/GHSA-559g-3h98-g3fj", "ref_desc": "Authenticated SQL Injection \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Leantime/leantime \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
