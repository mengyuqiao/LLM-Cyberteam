{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-46235", "Description": "FOG is a free open-source cloning/imaging/rescue suite/inventory management system. Prior to version 1.5.10.15, due to a lack of request sanitization in the logs, a malicious request containing XSS would be stored in a log file. When an administrator of the FOG server logged in and viewed the logs, they would be parsed as HTML and displayed accordingly. Version 1.5.10.15 contains a patch. As a workaround, view logs from an external text editor rather than the dashboard.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46235", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nFogproject\u00bbFogprojectVersions  before (<) 1.5.10.15cpe:2.3:a:fogproject:fogproject:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 32 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-02  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-11-06  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-09-30  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-11-09  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-80 Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/80/Improper-Neutralization-of-Script-Related-HTML-Tags-in-a-Web.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/FOGProject/fogproject/security/advisories/GHSA-cvf7-7mvq-5694", "ref_desc": "Stored XSS on log screen via unsanitized request logging. \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 FOGProject/fogproject \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/FOGProject/fogproject/commit/2e2421f19620669b9930f72fb73a8dbc5efe4980", "ref_desc": "Implement log sanitization \u00b7 FOGProject/fogproject@2e2421f \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
