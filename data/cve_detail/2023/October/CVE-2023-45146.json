{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-45146", "Description": "XXL-RPC is a high performance, distributed RPC framework. With it, a TCP server can be set up using the Netty framework and the Hessian serialization mechanism. When such a configuration is used, attackers may be able to connect to the server and provide malicious serialized objects that, once deserialized, force it to execute arbitrary code. This can be abused to take control of the machine the server is running by way of remote code execution. This issue has not been fixed.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45146", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nXxl-rpc Project\u00bbXxl-rpcVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.7.0cpe:2.3:a:xxl-rpc_project:xxl-rpc:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.25% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 65 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-19  0.29%  0.25%  -0.04 \n 2  2024-10-24  0.18%  0.29%  +0.12 \n 3  2024-09-17  0.15%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-10-31  0.05%  0.15%  +0.11 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2023-052_XXL-RPC/", "ref_desc": "GHSL-2023-052: Unsafe deserialization in XXL-RPC - CVE-2023-45146 | GitHub Security LabProduct;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
