{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-45811", "Description": "Synchrony deobfuscator is a javascript cleaner & deobfuscator.  A `__proto__` pollution vulnerability exists in versions before v2.4.4. Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution. A `__proto__` pollution vulnerability exists in the `LiteralMap` transformer allowing crafted input to modify properties in the Object prototype. A fix has been released in `deobfuscator@2.4.4`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should launch node with the [--disable-proto=delete][disable-proto] or [--disable-proto=throw][disable-proto] flags", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45811", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nRelative\u00bbSynchrony\u00bbForNodejsVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.1andbefore (<) 2.4.4cpe:2.3:a:relative:synchrony:*:*:*:*:*:nodejs:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 8 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-10-26  0.05%  0.04%  0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1321 Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1321/Improperly-Controlled-Modification-of-Object-Prototype-Attri.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/relative/synchrony/security/advisories/src/transformers/literalmap.ts", "ref_desc": "Broken Link", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/relative/synchrony/commit/b583126be94c4db7c5a478f1c5204bfb4162cf40", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-jg82-xh3w-rhxx \u00b7 relative/synchrony@b583126 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/relative/synchrony/security/advisories/GHSA-jg82-xh3w-rhxx", "ref_desc": "Prototype pollution vulnerability leading to arbitrary code execution \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 relative/synchrony \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
