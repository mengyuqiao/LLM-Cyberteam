{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-44390", "Description": "HtmlSanitizer is a .NET library for cleaning HTML fragments and documents from constructs that can lead to XSS attacks. The vulnerability occurs in configurations where foreign content is allowed, i.e. either `svg` or `math` are in the list of allowed elements. In the case an application sanitizes user input with a vulnerable configuration, an attacker could bypass the sanitization and inject arbitrary HTML, including JavaScript code. Note that in the default configuration the vulnerability is not present. The vulnerability has been fixed in versions 8.0.723 and 8.1.722-beta (preview version).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-44390", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nHtmlsanitizer Project\u00bbHtmlsanitizerVersions  before (<) 8.0.723cpe:2.3:a:htmlsanitizer_project:htmlsanitizer:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nHtmlsanitizer Project\u00bbHtmlsanitizer\u00bbVersion:8.1.719UpdateBetacpe:2.3:a:htmlsanitizer_project:htmlsanitizer:8.1.719:beta:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-06  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-10-11  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-09-04  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-10-13  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/mganss/HtmlSanitizer/security/advisories/GHSA-43cp-6p3q-2pc4", "ref_desc": "XSS in Foreign Content \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 mganss/HtmlSanitizer \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mganss/HtmlSanitizer/commit/ab29319866c020f0cc11e6b92228cd8039196c6e", "ref_desc": "Merge branch 'advisory-fix-1' \u00b7 mganss/HtmlSanitizer@ab29319 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
