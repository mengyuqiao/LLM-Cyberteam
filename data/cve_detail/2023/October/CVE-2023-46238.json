{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-46238", "Description": "ZITADEL is an identity infrastructure management system. ZITADEL users can upload their own avatar image using various image types including SVG. SVG can include scripts, such as javascript, which can be executed during rendering. Due to a missing security header, an attacker could inject code to an SVG to gain access to the victim\u2019s account in certain scenarios. A victim would need to directly open the malicious image in the browser, where a single session in ZITADEL needs to be active for this exploit to work. If the possible victim had multiple or no active sessions in ZITADEL, the attack would not succeed. This issue has been patched in version 2.39.2 and 2.38.2.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46238", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-01  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-09-25  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-11-08  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.39.2", "ref_desc": "Release v2.39.2 \u00b7 zitadel/zitadel \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/security/advisories/GHSA-954h-jrpm-72pm", "ref_desc": "XSS with User Avatar image \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 zitadel/zitadel \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.38.2", "ref_desc": "Release v2.38.2 \u00b7 zitadel/zitadel \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
