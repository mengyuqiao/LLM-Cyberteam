{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-45670", "Description": "Frigate is an open source network video recorder. Prior to version 0.13.0 Beta 3, the `config/save` and `config/set` endpoints of Frigate do not implement any CSRF protection. This makes it possible for a request sourced from another site to update the configuration of the Frigate server (e.g. via \"drive-by\" attack). Exploiting this vulnerability requires the attacker to both know very specific information about a user's Frigate server and requires an authenticated user to be tricked into clicking a specially crafted link to their Frigate instance. This vulnerability could exploited by an attacker under the following circumstances: Frigate publicly exposed to the internet (even with authentication); attacker knows the address of a user's Frigate instance; attacker crafts a specialized page which links to the user's Frigate instance; attacker finds a way to get an authenticated user to visit their specialized page and click the button/link. This issue can lead to arbitrary configuration updates for the Frigate server, resulting in denial of service and possible data exfiltration. Version 0.13.0 Beta 3 contains a patch.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45670", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF);Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nFrigate\u00bbFrigateVersions  up to, including, (<=) 0.13.0cpe:2.3:a:frigate:frigate:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFrigate\u00bbFrigate\u00bbVersion:0.13.0UpdateBeta1cpe:2.3:a:frigate:frigate:0.13.0:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFrigate\u00bbFrigate\u00bbVersion:0.13.0UpdateBeta2cpe:2.3:a:frigate:frigate:0.13.0:beta2:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-02  0.12%  0.15%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-11-18  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-11-05  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-09-29  0.07%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-12-14  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-11-09  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/security/advisories/GHSA-xq49-hv88-jr6h", "ref_desc": "Cross-site request forgery in `config_save` and `config_set` request handlers (GHSL-2023-198) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 blakeblackshear/frigate \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/blob/5658e5a4cc7376504af9de5e1eff178939a13e7f/frigate/http.py#L1060", "ref_desc": "frigate/frigate/http.py at 5658e5a4cc7376504af9de5e1eff178939a13e7f \u00b7 blakeblackshear/frigate \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/discussions/8366", "ref_desc": "0.13.0 Beta 3 \u00b7 blakeblackshear/frigate \u00b7 Discussion #8366 \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2023-190_Frigate/", "ref_desc": "GHSL-2023-190: Several vulnerabilities in Frigate - CVE-2023-45672, CVE-2023-45671, CVE-2023-45670 | GitHub Security LabCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/GHsLzANUjWwA9SX4CYcMr4gwyvk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/blob/6aedc39a9a421cf48000a727f36b4c1495848a1d/frigate/http.py#L998", "ref_desc": "frigate/frigate/http.py at 6aedc39a9a421cf48000a727f36b4c1495848a1d \u00b7 blakeblackshear/frigate \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/09/07/why-are-developers-vulnerable-to-driveby-attacks/", "ref_desc": "Why are developers so vulnerable to drive-by attacks? | GitLabNot Applicable", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
