{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-45669", "Description": "WebAuthn4J Spring Security provides Web Authentication specification support for Spring applications. Affected versions are subject to improper signature counter value handling. A flaw was found in webauthn4j-spring-security-core. When an authneticator returns an incremented signature counter value during authentication, webauthn4j-spring-security-core does not properly persist the value, which means cloned authenticator detection does not work. An attacker who cloned valid authenticator in some way can use the cloned authenticator without being detected. This issue has been addressed in version `0.9.1.RELEASE`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45669", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nWebauthn4j\u00bbSpring Security\u00bbForSpringVersions  before (<) 0.9.1cpe:2.3:a:webauthn4j:spring_security:*:*:*:*:*:spring:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 36 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-17  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-22  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-09-15  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-10-21  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/webauthn4j/webauthn4j-spring-security/security/advisories/GHSA-v9hx-v6vf-g36j", "ref_desc": "Improper signature counter value handling \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 webauthn4j/webauthn4j-spring-security \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/REC-webauthn-2-20210408/#sctn-sign-counter", "ref_desc": "Web Authentication: An API for accessing Public Key Credentials - Level 2Technical Description", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/webauthn4j/webauthn4j-spring-security/commit/129700d74d83f9b9a82bf88ebc63707e3cb0a725", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-v9hx-v6vf-g36j \u00b7 webauthn4j/webauthn4j-spring-security@129700d \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
