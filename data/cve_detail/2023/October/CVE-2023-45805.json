{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-45805", "Description": "pdm is a Python package and dependency manager supporting the latest PEP standards. It's possible to craft a malicious `pdm.lock` file that could allow e.g. an insider or a malicious open source project to appear to depend on a trusted PyPI project, but actually install another project. A project `foo` can be targeted by creating the project `foo-2` and uploading the file `foo-2-2.tar.gz` to pypi.org. PyPI will see this as project `foo-2` version `2`, while PDM will see this as project `foo` version `2-2`. The version must only be `parseable as a version` and the filename must be a prefix of the project name, but it's not verified to match the version being installed. Version `2-2` is also not a valid normalized version per PEP 440. Matching the project name exactly (not just prefix) would fix the issue. When installing dependencies with PDM, what's actually installed could differ from what's listed in `pyproject.toml` (including arbitrary code execution on install). It could also be used for downgrade attacks by only changing the version. This issue has been addressed in commit `6853e2642df` which is included in release version `2.9.4`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45805", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nFrostming\u00bbUnearth\u00bbForPythonVersions  before (<) 0.11.2cpe:2.3:a:frostming:unearth:*:*:*:*:*:python:*:*Matching versions\nFrostming\u00bbPDM\u00bbForPythonVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.10.0cpe:2.3:a:frostming:pdm:*:*:*:*:*:python:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 28 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-21  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-07-23  0.07%  0.05%  -0.02 \n 3  2023-10-28  0.05%  0.07%  +0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/blob/45d1dfa47d4900c14a31b9bb761e4c46eb5c9442/src/pdm/models/candidates.py#L98-L99", "ref_desc": "pdm/src/pdm/models/candidates.py at 45d1dfa47d4900c14a31b9bb761e4c46eb5c9442 \u00b7 pdm-project/pdm \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/#post-release-spelling", "ref_desc": "PEP 440 \u2013 Version Identification and Dependency Specification | peps.python.orgNot Applicable", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/commit/6853e2642dfa281d4a9958fbc6c95b7e32d84831", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-j44v-mmf2-xvm9 \u00b7 pdm-project/pdm@6853e26 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/frostming/unearth/blob/eca170d9370ac5032f2e497ee9b1b63823d3fe0f/src/unearth/evaluator.py#L215-L229", "ref_desc": "unearth/src/unearth/evaluator.py at eca170d9370ac5032f2e497ee9b1b63823d3fe0f \u00b7 frostming/unearth \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/security/advisories/GHSA-j44v-mmf2-xvm9", "ref_desc": "Trojan Lockfile \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 pdm-project/pdm \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
