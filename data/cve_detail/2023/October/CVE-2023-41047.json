{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-41047", "Description": "OctoPrint is a web interface for 3D printers. OctoPrint versions up until and including 1.9.2 contain a vulnerability that allows malicious admins to configure a specially crafted GCODE script that will allow code execution during rendering of that script. An attacker might use this to extract data managed by OctoPrint, or manipulate data managed by OctoPrint, as well as execute arbitrary commands with the rights of the OctoPrint process on the server system. OctoPrint versions from 1.9.3 onward have been patched. Administrators of OctoPrint instances are advised to make sure they can trust all other administrators on their instance and to also not blindly configure arbitrary GCODE scripts found online or provided to them by third parties.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-41047", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOctoprint\u00bbOctoprintVersions  before (<) 1.9.3cpe:2.3:a:octoprint:octoprint:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 8 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-10-15  0.05%  0.04%  -0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1336 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1336/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-Used-in-a-Templa.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/security/advisories/GHSA-fwfg-vprh-97ph", "ref_desc": "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine in OctoPrint \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 OctoPrint/OctoPrint \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/commit/d0072cff894509c77e243d6562245ad3079e17db", "ref_desc": "Merge branch 'bug/gcode_script_vuln' into staging/bugfix \u00b7 OctoPrint/OctoPrint@d0072cf \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/releases/tag/1.9.3", "ref_desc": "Release 1.9.3 \u00b7 OctoPrint/OctoPrint \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
