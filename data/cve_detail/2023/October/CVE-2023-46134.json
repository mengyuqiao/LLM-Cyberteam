{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-46134", "Description": "D-Tale is the combination of a Flask back-end and a React front-end to view & analyze Pandas data structures. Prior to version 3.7.0, users hosting D-Tale publicly can be vulnerable to remote code execution, allowing attackers to run malicious code on the server. This issue has been patched in version 3.7.0 by turning off \"Custom Filter\" input by default. The only workaround for versions earlier than 3.7.0 is to only host D-Tale to trusted users.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46134", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nMAN\u00bbD-taleVersions  before (<) 3.7.0cpe:2.3:a:man:d-tale:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.57% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 78 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-26  0.49%  0.57%  +0.07 \n 2  2024-10-31  0.32%  0.49%  +0.17 \n 3  2024-09-24  0.28%  0.32%  +0.04 \n 4  2023-11-07  0.05%  0.28%  +0.22 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/man-group/dtale/commit/bf8c54ab2490803f45f0652a9a0e221a94d39668", "ref_desc": "Updated 'Custom Filter' feature to be disabled by default \u00b7 man-group/dtale@bf8c54a \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/man-group/dtale/security/advisories/GHSA-jq6c-r9xf-qxjm", "ref_desc": "Remote Code Execution through the Custom Filter Input \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 man-group/dtale \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
