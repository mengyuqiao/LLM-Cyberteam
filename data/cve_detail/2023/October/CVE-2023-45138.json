{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-45138", "Description": "Change Request is an pplication allowing users to request changes on a wiki without publishing the changes directly. Starting in version 0.11 and prior to version 1.9.2, it's possible for a user without any specific right to perform script injection and remote code execution just by inserting an appropriate title when creating a new Change Request. This vulnerability is particularly critical as Change Request aims at being created by user without any particular rights. The vulnerability has been fixed in Change Request 1.9.2. It's possible to workaround the issue without upgrading by editing the document `ChangeRequest.Code.ChangeRequestSheet` and by performing the same change as in the fix commit.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45138", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nXwiki\u00bbChange RequestVersions  from including (>=) 0.11andbefore (<) 1.9.2cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:change_request:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.51% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 77 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-13  0.44%  0.51%  +0.07 \n 2  2024-10-18  0.41%  0.44%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-10-07  0.34%  0.41%  +0.07 \n 4  2024-09-11  0.30%  0.34%  +0.05 \n 5  2023-10-19  0.06%  0.30%  +0.23 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/application-changerequest/security/advisories/GHSA-f776-w9v2-7vfj", "ref_desc": "XSS and remote code execution through change request title \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 xwiki-contrib/application-changerequest \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/application-changerequest/commit/7565e720117f73102f5a276239eabfe85e15cff4", "ref_desc": "CRAPP-298: Bad rendering of title with UTF-8 \u00b7 xwiki-contrib/application-changerequest@7565e72 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/CRAPP-298", "ref_desc": "[CRAPP-298] XSS through title of change request - XWiki.org JIRAIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
