{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-45132", "Description": "NAXSI is an open-source maintenance web application firewall (WAF) for NGINX. An issue present starting in version 1.3 and prior to version 1.6 allows someone to bypass the WAF when a malicious `X-Forwarded-For` IP matches `IgnoreIP` `IgnoreCIDR` rules. This old code was arranged to allow older NGINX versions to also support `IgnoreIP` `IgnoreCIDR` when multiple reverse proxies were present. The issue is patched in version 1.6. As a workaround, do not set any `IgnoreIP` `IgnoreCIDR` for older versions.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45132", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nWargio\u00bbNaxsi\u00bbForNginxVersions  from including (>=) 1.3andbefore (<) 1.6cpe:2.3:a:wargio:naxsi:*:*:*:*:*:nginx:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-12  0.14%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-10-17  0.07%  0.14%  +0.06 \n 3  2024-09-10  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-10-18  0.13%  0.06%  -0.07 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-693 Protection Mechanism Failure", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/693/Protection-Mechanism-Failure.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/wargio/naxsi/pull/103", "ref_desc": "Remove X-Forwarded-For header special processing by lubomudr \u00b7 Pull Request #103 \u00b7 wargio/naxsi \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wargio/naxsi/security/advisories/GHSA-7qjc-q4j9-pc8x", "ref_desc": "IgnoreIP/IgnoreCIDR should not trust X-Forwarded-For \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 wargio/naxsi \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wargio/naxsi/commit/1b712526ed3314dd6be7e8b0259eabda63c19537", "ref_desc": "Remove X-Forwarded-For header special processing (#103) \u00b7 wargio/naxsi@1b71252 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
