This could be used to exhaust worker resources in the server, similar to the well known \"slow loris\" attack pattern.\nThis has been fixed in version 2.4.58, so that such connection are terminated properly after the configured connection timeout.\n\nThis issue affects Apache HTTP Server: from 2.4.55 through 2.4.57.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.58, which fixes the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-43622", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbHttp ServerVersions  from including (>=) 2.4.55andbefore (<) 2.4.58cpe:2.3:a:apache:http_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-24  0.17%  0.12%  -0.04 \n 2  2024-10-29  0.06%  0.17%  +0.10 \n 3  2023-11-02  0.04%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html", "ref_desc": "httpd 2.4 vulnerabilities - The Apache HTTP Server ProjectVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/bRHJW4C-Q8TD4xU-vQxvHsw9lnk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231027-0011/", "ref_desc": "October 2023 Apache HTTP Server Vulnerabilities in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/GV9nYU90pJ2IFRFAKxw_i75WF9U.html"}]}
