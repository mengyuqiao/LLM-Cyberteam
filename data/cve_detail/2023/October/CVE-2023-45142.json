{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-45142", "Description": "OpenTelemetry-Go Contrib is a collection of third-party packages for OpenTelemetry-Go. A handler wrapper out of the box adds labels `http.user_agent` and `http.method` that have unbound cardinality. It leads to the server's potential memory exhaustion when many malicious requests are sent to it. HTTP header User-Agent or HTTP method for requests can be easily set by an attacker to be random and long. The library internally uses `httpconv.ServerRequest` that records every value for HTTP `method` and `User-Agent`. In order to be affected, a program has to use the `otelhttp.NewHandler` wrapper and not filter any unknown HTTP methods or User agents on the level of CDN, LB, previous middleware, etc. Version 0.44.0 fixed this issue when the values collected for attribute `http.request.method` were changed to be restricted to a set of well-known values and other high cardinality attributes were removed. As a workaround to stop being affected, `otelhttp.WithFilter()` can be used, but it requires manual careful configuration to not log certain requests entirely. For convenience and safe usage of this library, it should by default mark with the label `unknown` non-standard HTTP methods and User agents to show that such requests were made but do not increase cardinality. In case someone wants to stay with the current behavior, library API should allow to enable it.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45142", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOpentelemetry\u00bbOpentelemetry\u00bbForGOVersions  before (<) 0.44.0cpe:2.3:a:opentelemetry:opentelemetry:*:*:*:*:*:go:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.25% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 66 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-13  0.21%  0.25%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-10-18  0.14%  0.21%  +0.08 \n 3  2024-09-11  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-10-19  0.04%  0.12%  +0.07 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib/releases/tag/v1.19.0", "ref_desc": "Release Release v1.19.0/v0.44.0/v0.13.0 \u00b7 open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib/pull/4277", "ref_desc": "Remove high cardanility metrics from otelhttp by MadVikingGod \u00b7 Pull Request #4277 \u00b7 open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go/blob/v1.12.0/semconv/internal/v2/http.go#L159", "ref_desc": "opentelemetry-go/http.go at v1.12.0 \u00b7 open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go \u00b7 GitHubProductCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/LHZoHBAhT7r60C6C9h7EJsyg8NY.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib/security/advisories/GHSA-5r5m-65gx-7vrh", "ref_desc": "DoS vulnerability for high cardinality metrics in otelhttp and otelbeego \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib \u00b7 GitHubVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/OsXQlUxoHVPvwh_OLAhmymS9Cv4.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cg3q-j54f-5p7p", "ref_desc": "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption in promhttp \u00b7 CVE-2022-21698 \u00b7 GitHub Advisory Database \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go/blob/38e1b499c3da3107694ad2660b3888eee9c8b896/semconv/internal/v2/http.go#L223", "ref_desc": "opentelemetry-go/semconv/internal/v2/http.go at 38e1b499c3da3107694ad2660b3888eee9c8b896 \u00b7 open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib/blob/5f7e6ad5a49b45df45f61a1deb29d7f1158032df/instrumentation/net/http/otelhttp/handler.go#L63-L65", "ref_desc": "opentelemetry-go-contrib/instrumentation/net/http/otelhttp/handler.go at 5f7e6ad5a49b45df45f61a1deb29d7f1158032df \u00b7 open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2UTRJ54INZG3OC2FTAN6AFB2RYNY2GAD/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 39 Update: caddy-2.7.6-1.fc39 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib/security/advisories/GHSA-rcjv-mgp8-qvmr", "ref_desc": "DoS vulnerability in otelhttp (uncontrolled resource consumption) due to unbound cardinality metrics \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
