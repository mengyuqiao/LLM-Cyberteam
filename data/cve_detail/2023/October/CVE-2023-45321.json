Due to the lack of encryption of HTTP,this issue allows an attacker placed in the same subnet network of the HMI device to intercept username and password necessary to authenticate to the MQTT server responsible to implement the remote management protocol.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45321", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nBoschrexroth\u00bbCtrlx Hmi Web Panel Wr2107 Firmwarecpe:2.3:o:boschrexroth:ctrlx_hmi_web_panel_wr2107_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Boschrexroth\u00bbCtrlx Hmi Web Panel Wr2107\u00bbVersion:N/A\nBoschrexroth\u00bbCtrlx Hmi Web Panel Wr2110 Firmwarecpe:2.3:o:boschrexroth:ctrlx_hmi_web_panel_wr2110_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Boschrexroth\u00bbCtrlx Hmi Web Panel Wr2110\u00bbVersion:N/A\nBoschrexroth\u00bbCtrlx Hmi Web Panel Wr2115 Firmwarecpe:2.3:o:boschrexroth:ctrlx_hmi_web_panel_wr2115_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Boschrexroth\u00bbCtrlx Hmi Web Panel Wr2115\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 14 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-11-07  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-319 Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/319/Cleartext-Transmission-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://psirt.bosch.com/security-advisories/BOSCH-SA-175607.html", "ref_desc": "Multiple vulnerabilities on ctrlX HMI Web Panel - WR21 | Bosch PSIRTMitigation;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/a_7sGQalCC9AzzsJ69TxmTrOa-E.html"}]}
