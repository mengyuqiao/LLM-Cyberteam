{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-44388", "Description": "Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. A malicious request can cause production log files to quickly fill up and thus result in the server running out of disk space. This problem has been patched in the 3.1.1 stable and 3.2.0.beta2 versions of Discourse. It is possible to temporarily work around this problem by reducing the `client_max_body_size nginx directive`. `client_max_body_size` will limit the size of uploads that can be uploaded directly to the server.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-44388", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bb     StableEditionVersions  up to, including, (<=) 3.1.1cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:*:*:*:*:stable:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bbVersion:3.2.0UpdateBeta1   BetaEditioncpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:3.2.0:beta1:*:*:beta:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-17  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-22  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-09-15  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-10-21  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/security/advisories/GHSA-89h3-g746-xmwq", "ref_desc": "Malicious requests can fill up the log files resulting in a DoS on the server \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 discourse/discourse \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#client_max_body_size", "ref_desc": "Module ngx_http_core_moduleThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
