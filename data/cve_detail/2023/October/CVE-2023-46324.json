{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-46324", "Description": "pkg/suci/suci.go in free5GC udm before 1.2.0, when Go before 1.19 is used, allows an Invalid Curve Attack because it may compute a shared secret via an uncompressed public key that has not been validated. An attacker can send arbitrary SUCIs to the UDM, which tries to decrypt them via both its private key and the attacker's public key.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46324", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nFree5gc\u00bbUDM\u00bbForGOVersions  before (<) 1.2.0cpe:2.3:a:free5gc:udm:*:*:*:*:*:go:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Golang\u00bbGO", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-24  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-29  0.07%  0.12%  +0.05 \n 3  2024-09-22  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-01-10  0.09%  0.06%  -0.02 \n 5  2023-10-31  0.04%  0.09%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.gsma.com/security/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/0073-invalid_curve.pdf", "ref_desc": "", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/free5gc/udm/pull/20", "ref_desc": "Prevent Invalid Curve Attack on 5G SUCI Feature by Roy-Hu \u00b7 Pull Request #20 \u00b7 free5gc/udm \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/free5gc/udm/compare/v1.1.1...v1.2.0", "ref_desc": "Comparing v1.1.1...v1.2.0 \u00b7 free5gc/udm \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
