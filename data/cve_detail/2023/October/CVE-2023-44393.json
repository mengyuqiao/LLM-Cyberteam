{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-44393", "Description": "Piwigo is an open source photo gallery application. Prior to version 14.0.0beta4, a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability is in the` /admin.php?page=plugins&tab=new&installstatus=ok&plugin_id=[here]` page. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious HTML and JS code into the HTML page, which could then be executed by admin users when they visit the URL with the payload. The vulnerability is caused by the insecure injection of the `plugin_id` value from the URL into the HTML page. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious URL that contains a specially crafted `plugin_id` value. When a victim who is logged in as an administrator visits this URL, the malicious code will be injected into the HTML page and executed. This vulnerability can be exploited by any attacker who has access to a malicious URL. However, only users who are logged in as administrators are affected. This is because the vulnerability is only present on the `/admin.php?page=plugins&tab=new&installstatus=ok&plugin_id=[here]` page, which is only accessible to administrators. Version 14.0.0.beta4 contains a patch for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-44393", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nPiwigo\u00bbPiwigoVersions  up to, including, (<=) 13.8.0cpe:2.3:a:piwigo:piwigo:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPiwigo\u00bbPiwigo\u00bbVersion:14.0.0UpdateBeta1cpe:2.3:a:piwigo:piwigo:14.0.0:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPiwigo\u00bbPiwigo\u00bbVersion:14.0.0UpdateBeta2cpe:2.3:a:piwigo:piwigo:14.0.0:beta2:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPiwigo\u00bbPiwigo\u00bbVersion:14.0.0UpdateBeta3cpe:2.3:a:piwigo:piwigo:14.0.0:beta3:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 45 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-10  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-28  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-10-15  0.08%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-09-08  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-08-15  0.07%  0.07%  0.00 \n 6  2024-07-29  0.05%  0.07%  +0.03 \n 7  2023-10-15  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-80 Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/80/Improper-Neutralization-of-Script-Related-HTML-Tags-in-a-Web.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/Piwigo/Piwigo/commit/cc99c0f1e967c5f1722a0cce30ff42374a7bbc23", "ref_desc": "fixes GHSA-qg85-957m-7vgg providing plugin_id in URL is useless since\u2026 \u00b7 Piwigo/Piwigo@cc99c0f \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Piwigo/Piwigo/security/advisories/GHSA-qg85-957m-7vgg", "ref_desc": "Reflected XSS in /admin.php?page=plugins&tab=new&installstatus=ok&plugin_id=[here] \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Piwigo/Piwigo \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
