{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-44387", "Description": "Gradle is a build tool with a focus on build automation and support for multi-language development. When copying or archiving symlinked files, Gradle resolves them but applies the permissions of the symlink itself instead of the permissions of the linked file to the resulting file. This leads to files having too much permissions given that symlinks usually are world readable and writeable. While it is unlikely this results in a direct vulnerability for the impacted build, it may open up attack vectors depending on where build artifacts end up being copied to or un-archived. In versions 7.6.3, 8.4 and above, Gradle will now properly use the permissions of the file pointed at by the symlink to set permissions of the copied or archived file.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-44387", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGradle\u00bbGradleVersions  before (<) 7.6.3cpe:2.3:a:gradle:gradle:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGradle\u00bbGradleVersions  from including (>=) 8.0.0andbefore (<) 8.4.0cpe:2.3:a:gradle:gradle:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 12 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/732/Incorrect-Permission-Assignment-for-Critical-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/gradle/gradle/commit/3b406191e24d69e7e42dc3f3b5cc50625aa930b7", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #26584 Backport of fixes to 7.6.3 \u00b7 gradle/gradle@3b40619 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gradle/gradle/security/advisories/GHSA-43r3-pqhv-f7h9", "ref_desc": "Incorrect permission assignment for symlinked files used in copy or archiving operations \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 gradle/gradle \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231110-0006/", "ref_desc": "October 2023 Gradle Vulnerabilities in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/GK_BEgj2gCctNm716e0az4WiQlE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gradle/gradle/releases/tag/v8.4.0", "ref_desc": "Release 8.4 \u00b7 gradle/gradle \u00b7 GitHubRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/kdLjieGJazaTeRulMrvIOcza5Ms.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gradle/gradle/releases/tag/v7.6.3", "ref_desc": "Release 7.6.3 \u00b7 gradle/gradle \u00b7 GitHubRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/QXXnTdVmVtCHjFZKU1TuwxOXsAg.html"}]}
