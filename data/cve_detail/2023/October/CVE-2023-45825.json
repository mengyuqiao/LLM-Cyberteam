{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-45825", "Description": "ydb-go-sdk is a pure Go native and database/sql driver for the YDB platform. Since ydb-go-sdk v3.48.6 if you use a custom credentials object (implementation of interface Credentials it may leak into logs. This happens because this object could be serialized into an error message using `fmt.Errorf(\"something went wrong (credentials: %q)\", credentials)` during connection to the YDB server. If such logging occurred, a  malicious user with access to logs could read sensitive information (i.e. credentials) information and use it to get access to the database. ydb-go-sdk contains this problem in versions from v3.48.6 to v3.53.2. The fix for this problem has been released in version v3.53.3. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should implement the `fmt.Stringer` interface in your custom credentials type with explicit stringify of object state.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45825", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nYDB\u00bbYdb-go-sdk\u00bbForGOVersions  from including (>=) 3.48.6andbefore (<) 3.53.2cpe:2.3:a:ydb:ydb-go-sdk:*:*:*:*:*:go:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 13 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n Could not find any EPSS score change records for this CVE ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-532 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/532/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-into-Log-File.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb-go-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-q24m-6h38-5xj8", "ref_desc": "Token in custom credentials object can leak through logs \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ydb-platform/ydb-go-sdk \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb-go-sdk/pull/859", "ref_desc": "* Refactored credentials options (from funcs to interfaces and types) by asmyasnikov \u00b7 Pull Request #859 \u00b7 ydb-platform/ydb-go-sdk \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb-go-sdk/blob/master/credentials/credentials.go#L10", "ref_desc": "ydb-go-sdk/credentials/credentials.go at master \u00b7 ydb-platform/ydb-go-sdk \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb-go-sdk/blob/v3.48.6/internal/balancer/balancer.go#L71", "ref_desc": "ydb-go-sdk/internal/balancer/balancer.go at v3.48.6 \u00b7 ydb-platform/ydb-go-sdk \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
