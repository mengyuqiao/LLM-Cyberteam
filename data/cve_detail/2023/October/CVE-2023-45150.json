{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-45150", "Description": "Nextcloud calendar is a calendar app for the Nextcloud server platform. Due to missing precondition checks the server was trying to validate strings of any length as email addresses even when megabytes of data were provided, eventually making the server busy and unresponsive.

The only workaround for users unable to upgrade is to disable the calendar app.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45150", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNextcloud\u00bbCalendarVersions  from including (>=) 1.0andbefore (<) 4.4.4cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:calendar:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-22  0.06%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-09-15  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-10-21  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-354 Improper Validation of Integrity Check Value", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/354/Improper-Validation-of-Integrity-Check-Value.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-r936-8gwm-w452", "ref_desc": "Inviting excessive long email addresses to a calendar event makes the server unresponsive \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nextcloud/security-advisories \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/calendar/pull/5358", "ref_desc": "fix(sharing): skip long email addresses by st3iny \u00b7 Pull Request #5358 \u00b7 nextcloud/calendar \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/2058337", "ref_desc": "Nextcloud | Report #2058337 - Inviting excessive long email addresses to a calendar event makes the server unresponsive | HackerOneExploit;Issue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
