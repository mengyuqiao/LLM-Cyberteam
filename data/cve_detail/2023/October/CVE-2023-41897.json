{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-41897", "Description": "Home assistant is an open source home automation. Home Assistant server does not set any HTTP security headers, including the X-Frame-Options header, which specifies whether the web page is allowed to be framed. The omission of this and correlating headers facilitates covert clickjacking attacks and alternative exploit opportunities, such as the vector described in this security advisory. This fault incurs major risk, considering the ability to trick users into installing an external and malicious add-on with minimal user interaction, which would enable Remote Code Execution (RCE) within the Home Assistant application. This issue has been addressed in version 2023.9.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-41897", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nHome-assistant\u00bbHome-assistantVersions  before (<) 2023.9.0cpe:2.3:a:home-assistant:home-assistant:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.26% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 67 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-20  0.25%  0.26%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-25  0.21%  0.25%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-09-18  0.18%  0.21%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-10-27  0.06%  0.18%  +0.12 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-1021 Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1021/Improper-Restriction-of-Rendered-UI-Layers-or-Frames.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/home-assistant/core/security/advisories/GHSA-cr83-q7r2-7f5q", "ref_desc": "Fake WS server installation permits full takeover \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 home-assistant/core \u00b7 GitHubNot ApplicableCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/c7_ig3wdNYc9NrT1cNPCk23YKRU.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/home-assistant/core/security/advisories/GHSA-935v-rmg9-44mw", "ref_desc": "Lack of XFO header allows clickjacking \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 home-assistant/core \u00b7 GitHubVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/qIFUyvZKx0BpMYouodTI8S-ldBw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2023/10/19/security-audits-of-home-assistant/", "ref_desc": "Security audits of Home Assistant - Home AssistantVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/zwmDwr24LidXBA6gwAbCrVkZzHM.html"}]}
