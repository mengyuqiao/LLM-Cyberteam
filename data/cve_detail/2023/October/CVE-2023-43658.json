{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-43658", "Description": "dicourse-calendar is a plugin for the Discourse messaging platform which adds the ability to create a dynamic calendar in the first post of a topic. Improper escaping of event titles could lead to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) within the 'email preview' UI when a site has CSP disabled. Having CSP disabled is a non-default configuration, so the vast majority of sites are unaffected. This problem is resolved in the latest version of the discourse-calendar plugin. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure CSP is enabled on the forum.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-43658", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse Calendar\u00bbForDiscourseVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2023-10-16cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse_calendar:*:*:*:*:*:discourse:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 36 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-17  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-22  0.06%  0.07%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-09-15  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-10-21  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse-calendar/security/advisories/GHSA-3fwj-f6ww-7hr6", "ref_desc": "Improper escaping of user input can lead to XSS under non-default site configuration \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 discourse/discourse-calendar \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse-calendar/commit/9788310906febb36822d6823d14f1059c39644de", "ref_desc": "SECURITY: Properly escape user input when generating email HTML (#455) \u00b7 discourse/discourse-calendar@9788310 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP", "ref_desc": "Content Security Policy (CSP) - HTTP | MDNThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Y8KFbSVDaGCBboTYz8jPUezvzNA.html"}]}
