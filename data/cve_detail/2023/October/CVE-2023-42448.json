{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-42448", "Description": "Hydra is the layer-two scalability solution for Cardano. Prior to version 0.13.0, the specification states that the contestation period in the datum of the UTxO at the head validator must stay unchanged as the state progresses from Open to Closed (Close transaction), but no such check appears to be performed in the `checkClose` function of the head validator. This would allow a malicious participant to modify the contestation deadline of the head to either allow them to fanout the head without giving another participant the chance to contest, or prevent any participant from ever redistributing the funds locked in the head via a fan-out. Version 0.13.0 contains a patch for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-42448", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nIohk\u00bbHydraVersions  before (<) 0.13.0cpe:2.3:a:iohk:hydra:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 40 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-10  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-09-03  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-10-11  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-1284 Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/1284/Improper-Validation-of-Specified-Quantity-in-Input.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/commit/2f45529729e28254a62f7a7c8d6649066923ed1f", "ref_desc": "Ensure close transaction does not change contestation period \u00b7 input-output-hk/hydra@2f45529 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/blob/master/hydra-plutus/src/Hydra/Contract/Head.hs#L284-L296", "ref_desc": "hydra/hydra-plutus/src/Hydra/Contract/Head.hs at master \u00b7 input-output-hk/hydra \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/security/advisories/GHSA-mgcx-6p7h-5996", "ref_desc": "Contestation period in head datum can be modified during Close transaction, allowing malicious participant to freely modify the contestation deadline \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 input-output-hk/hydra \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0130---2023-10-03", "ref_desc": "hydra/CHANGELOG.md at master \u00b7 input-output-hk/hydra \u00b7 GitHubRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/v0T8vojrxG7teVdDbVBorb1uunI.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/blob/master/hydra-plutus/src/Hydra/Contract/Head.hs#L320-L323", "ref_desc": "hydra/hydra-plutus/src/Hydra/Contract/Head.hs at master \u00b7 input-output-hk/hydra \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
