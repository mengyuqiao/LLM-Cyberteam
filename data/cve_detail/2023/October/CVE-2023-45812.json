{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-45812", "Description": "The Apollo Router is a configurable, high-performance graph router written in Rust to run a federated supergraph that uses Apollo Federation. Affected versions are subject to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) type vulnerability which causes the Router to panic and terminate when a multi-part response is sent. When users send queries to the router that uses the `@defer` or Subscriptions, the Router will panic. To be vulnerable, users of Router must have a coprocessor with `coprocessor.supergraph.response` configured in their `router.yaml` and also to support either `@defer` or Subscriptions. Apollo Router version 1.33.0 has a fix for this vulnerability which was introduced in PR #4014. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should avoid using the coprocessor supergraph response or disable defer and subscriptions support and continue to use the coprocessor supergraph response.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45812", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nApollographql\u00bbApollo RouterVersions  from including (>=) 1.31.0andup to, including, (<=) 1.32.0cpe:2.3:a:apollographql:apollo_router:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nApollographql\u00bbApollo Helms-charts RouterVersions  from including (>=) 1.31.0andup to, including, (<=) 1.32.0cpe:2.3:a:apollographql:apollo_helms-charts_router:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-19  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-24  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-09-17  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-10-31  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-754 Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/754/Improper-Check-for-Unusual-or-Exceptional-Conditions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/4014", "ref_desc": "Fix and add test for co-processors handling of streaming responses by BrynCooke \u00b7 Pull Request #4014 \u00b7 apollographql/router \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/apollographql/router/security/advisories/GHSA-r344-xw3p-2frj", "ref_desc": "Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions in apollo-router \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 apollographql/router \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
