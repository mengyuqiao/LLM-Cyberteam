{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-46667", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Fleet Server >= v8.10.0 and < v8.10.3 where Agent enrolment tokens are being inserted into the Fleet Server\u2019s log file in plain text. These enrolment tokens could allow someone to enrol an agent into an agent policy, and potentially use that to retrieve other secrets in the policy including for Elasticsearch and third-party services. Alternatively a threat actor could potentially enrol agents to the clusters and send arbitrary events to Elasticsearch.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46667", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nElastic\u00bbFleet ServerVersions  from including (>=) 8.10.0andbefore (<) 8.10.3cpe:2.3:a:elastic:fleet_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-01  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-09-25  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-11-05  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-532 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/532/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-into-Log-File.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.elastic.co/community/security", "ref_desc": "Elastic Stack Security Disclosures \u00b7 Report Issues | ElasticVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/RMrGSY_VFXOZ71yMK5E8GE1-n1E.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://discuss.elastic.co/t/fleet-server-v8-10-3-security-update/344737", "ref_desc": "Fleet Server v8.10.3 Security Update - Announcements / Security Announcements - Discuss the Elastic StackRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
