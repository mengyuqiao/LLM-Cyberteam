{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-45683", "Description": "github.com/crewjam/saml is a saml library for the go language. In affected versions the package does not validate the ACS Location URI according to the SAML binding being parsed. If abused, this flaw allows attackers to register malicious Service Providers at the IdP and inject Javascript in the ACS endpoint definition, achieving Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) in the IdP context during the redirection at the end of a SAML SSO Flow. Consequently, an attacker may perform any authenticated action as the victim once the victim\u2019s browser loaded the SAML IdP initiated SSO link for the malicious service provider. Note: SP registration is commonly an unrestricted operation in IdPs, hence not requiring particular permissions or publicly accessible to ease the IdP interoperability. This issue is fixed in version 0.4.14. Users unable to upgrade may perform external validation of URLs provided in SAML metadata, or restrict the ability for end-users to upload arbitrary metadata.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45683", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nSaml Project\u00bbSaml\u00bbForGOVersions  before (<) 0.4.14cpe:2.3:a:saml_project:saml:*:*:*:*:*:go:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 31 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-17  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-22  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-09-15  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-10-21  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/crewjam/saml/security/advisories/GHSA-267v-3v32-g6q5", "ref_desc": "XSS via missing Binding syntax validation \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 crewjam/saml \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/crewjam/saml/commit/b07b16cf83c4171d16da4d85608cb827f183cd79", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-267v-3v32-g6q5 \u00b7 crewjam/saml@b07b16c \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
