{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-43814", "Description": "Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. Attackers with details specific to a poll in a topic can use the `/polls/grouped_poll_results` endpoint to view the content of options in the poll and the number of votes for groups of poll participants. This impacts private polls where the results were intended to only be viewable by authorized users. This issue is patched in the 3.1.1 stable and 3.2.0.beta2 versions of Discourse. There is no workaround for this issue apart from upgrading to the fixed version.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-43814", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege;Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bb     StableEditionVersions  up to, including, (<=) 3.1.1cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:*:*:*:*:stable:*:*:*Matching versions\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse\u00bbVersion:3.2.0UpdateBeta1   BetaEditioncpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse:3.2.0:beta1:*:*:beta:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 28 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-22  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-09-15  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-10-21  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/security/advisories/GHSA-3x57-846g-7qcw", "ref_desc": "Exposure of poll options and votes to unauthorized users \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 discourse/discourse \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
