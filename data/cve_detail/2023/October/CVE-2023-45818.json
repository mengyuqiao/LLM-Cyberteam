{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-45818", "Description": "TinyMCE is an open source rich text editor. A mutation cross-site scripting (mXSS) vulnerability was discovered in TinyMCE\u2019s core undo and redo functionality. When a carefully-crafted HTML snippet passes the XSS sanitisation layer, it is manipulated as a string by internal trimming functions before being stored in the undo stack. If the HTML snippet is restored from the undo stack, the combination of the string manipulation and reparative parsing by either the browser's native [DOMParser API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMParser) (TinyMCE 6) or the SaxParser API (TinyMCE 5) mutates the HTML maliciously, allowing an XSS payload to be executed. This vulnerability has been patched in TinyMCE 5.10.8 and TinyMCE 6.7.1 by ensuring HTML is trimmed using node-level manipulation instead of string manipulation. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45818", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nTiny\u00bbTinymceVersions  from including (>=) 6.0.0andbefore (<) 6.7.1cpe:2.3:a:tiny:tinymce:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTiny\u00bbTinymceVersions  before (<) 5.10.8cpe:2.3:a:tiny:tinymce:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 38 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-20  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-25  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-09-18  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-10-27  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/api/tinymce.html/tinymce.html.saxparser/", "ref_desc": "tinymce.html.SaxParser | Docs | TinyMCEProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tiny.cloud/docs/release-notes/release-notes5108/#securityfixes", "ref_desc": "TinyMCE 5.10.8 | Docs | TinyMCERelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://researchgate.net/publication/266654651_mXSS_attacks_Attacking_well-secured_web-applications_by_using_innerHTML_mutations", "ref_desc": "mXSS attacks: Attacking well-secured web-applications by using innerHTML mutations | Request PDFThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce/security/advisories/GHSA-v65r-p3vv-jjfv", "ref_desc": "mXSS vulnerability in TinyMCE undo/redo, getContent API, resetContent API, and Autosave plugin \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 tinymce/tinymce \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/6/6.7.1-release-notes/#security-fixes", "ref_desc": "TinyMCE 6.7.1 | TinyMCE DocumentationRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
