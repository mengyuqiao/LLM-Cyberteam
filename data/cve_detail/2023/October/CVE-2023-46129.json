{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-46129", "Description": "NATS.io is a high performance open source pub-sub distributed communication technology, built for the cloud, on-premise, IoT, and edge computing. The cryptographic key handling library, nkeys, recently gained support for encryption, not just for signing/authentication. This is used in nats-server 2.10 (Sep 2023) and newer for authentication callouts. In nkeys versions 0.4.0 through 0.4.5, corresponding with NATS server versions 2.10.0 through 2.10.3, the nkeys library's `xkeys` encryption handling logic mistakenly passed an array by value into an internal function, where the function mutated that buffer to populate the encryption key to use. As a result, all encryption was actually to an all-zeros key. This affects encryption only, not signing.  \nFIXME: FILL IN IMPACT ON NATS-SERVER AUTH CALLOUT SECURITY. nkeys Go library 0.4.6, corresponding with NATS Server 2.10.4, has a patch for this issue. No known workarounds are available. For any application handling auth callouts in Go, if using the nkeys library, update the dependency, recompile and deploy that in lockstep.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46129", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNats\u00bbNats ServerVersions  from including (>=) 2.10.0andbefore (<) 2.10.4cpe:2.3:a:nats:nats_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNats\u00bbNkeysVersions  from including (>=) 0.4.0andbefore (<) 0.4.6cpe:2.3:a:nats:nkeys:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 36 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-02  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-11-05  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-09-29  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-11-09  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-321 Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/321/Use-of-Hard-coded-Cryptographic-Key.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-325 Missing Cryptographic Step", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/325/Missing-Cryptographic-Step.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ULQQONMSCQSH5Z5OWFFQHCGEZ3NL4DRJ/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 38 Update: golang-github-nats-io-nkeys-0.4.6-1.fc38 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/7DuBouWioxZ5LSUtRnU4ay7xUpo.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/31/1", "ref_desc": "oss-security - NATS: 2023-02: nkeys: xkeys Seal encryption used fixed key for all encryptionMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/R3UETKPUB3V5JS5TLZOF3SMTGT5K5APS/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 39 Update: golang-github-nats-io-1.31.0-1.fc39 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/NR9dMnvZP-jA03ECQ8awZEVZW6U.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nats-io/nkeys/security/advisories/GHSA-mr45-rx8q-wcm9", "ref_desc": "xkeys Seal encryption used fixed key for all encryption \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nats-io/nkeys \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
