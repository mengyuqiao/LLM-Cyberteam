{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-40180", "Description": "silverstripe-graphql is a package which serves Silverstripe data in GraphQL representations. An attacker could use a recursive graphql query to execute a Distributed Denial of Service attack (DDOS attack) against a website. This mostly affects websites with publicly exposed graphql schemas. If your Silverstripe CMS project does not expose a public facing graphql schema, a user account is required to trigger the DDOS attack. If your site is hosted behind a content delivery network (CDN), such as Imperva or CloudFlare, this may further mitigate the risk. This issue has been addressed in versions 3.8.2, 4.1.3, 4.2.5, 4.3.4, and 5.0.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-40180", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nSilverstripe\u00bbGraphqlVersions  from including (>=) 4.0.0andbefore (<) 4.1.3cpe:2.3:a:silverstripe:graphql:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSilverstripe\u00bbGraphqlVersions  from including (>=) 4.3.0andbefore (<) 4.3.4cpe:2.3:a:silverstripe:graphql:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSilverstripe\u00bbGraphqlVersions  from including (>=) 3.0.0andbefore (<) 3.8.2cpe:2.3:a:silverstripe:graphql:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSilverstripe\u00bbGraphqlVersions  from including (>=) 5.0.0andbefore (<) 5.0.3cpe:2.3:a:silverstripe:graphql:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSilverstripe\u00bbGraphqlVersions  from including (>=) 4.2.0andbefore (<) 4.2.5cpe:2.3:a:silverstripe:graphql:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-17  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-10-22  0.07%  0.10%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-09-15  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-10-24  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.silverstripe.org/download/security-releases/CVE-2023-40180", "ref_desc": "CVE-2023-40180 - DDOS Vulnerability on GraphQL due to lack of protection against recursive queries \u00bb Silverstripe CMSVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-graphql/commit/f6d5976ec4608e51184b0db1ee5b9e9a99d2501c", "ref_desc": "[CVE-2023-40180] Add protection against recursive queries (#558) \u00b7 silverstripe/silverstripe-graphql@f6d5976 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-graphql/tree/3.8#recursive-or-complex-queries", "ref_desc": "GitHub - silverstripe/silverstripe-graphql at 3.8Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-graphql/security/advisories/GHSA-v23w-pppm-jh66", "ref_desc": "DDOS Vulnerability on GraphQL due to lack of protection against recursive queries \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 silverstripe/silverstripe-graphql \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/developer_guides/graphql/security_and_best_practices/recursive_or_complex_queries", "ref_desc": "Recursive or complex queries | Silverstripe CMS DocumentationMitigation", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
