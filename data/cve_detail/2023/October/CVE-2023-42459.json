{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-42459", "Description": "Fast DDS is a C++ implementation of the DDS (Data Distribution Service) standard of the OMG (Object Management Group). In affected versions specific DATA submessages can be sent to a discovery locator which may trigger a free error. This can remotely crash any Fast-DDS process. The call to free() could potentially leave the pointer in the attackers control which could lead to a double free. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.12.0, 2.11.3, 2.10.3, and 2.6.7. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-42459", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nEprosima\u00bbFast DdsVersions  from including (>=) 2.11.0andup to, including, (<=) 2.11.1cpe:2.3:a:eprosima:fast_dds:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEprosima\u00bbFast DdsVersions  before (<) 2.6.7cpe:2.3:a:eprosima:fast_dds:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nEprosima\u00bbFast DdsVersions  from including (>=) 2.10.0andbefore (<) 2.10.3cpe:2.3:a:eprosima:fast_dds:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-17  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-22  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-09-15  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-11-28  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-10-24  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-415 Double Free", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/415/Double-Free.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-416 Use After Free", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/416/Use-After-Free.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-590 Free of Memory not on the Heap", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/590/Free-of-Memory-not-on-the-Heap.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5568", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-5568-1 fastdds", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS/security/advisories/GHSA-gq8g-fj58-22gm", "ref_desc": "Malformed DATA submessage leads to bad-free error \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 eProsima/Fast-DDS \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS/pull/3824", "ref_desc": "[19416] Fix bad-free when receiving malformed DATA submessage by MiguelCompany \u00b7 Pull Request #3824 \u00b7 eProsima/Fast-DDS \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS/issues/3207", "ref_desc": "[16784] Malformed DATA submessage leads to bad-free during SPDP \u00b7 Issue #3207 \u00b7 eProsima/Fast-DDS \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
