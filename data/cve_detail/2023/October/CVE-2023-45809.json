{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-45809", "Description": "Wagtail is an open source content management system built on Django. A user with a limited-permission editor account for the Wagtail admin can make a direct URL request to the admin view that handles bulk actions on user accounts. While authentication rules prevent the user from making any changes, the error message discloses the display names of user accounts, and by modifying URL parameters, the user can retrieve the display name for any user. The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin. Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 4.1.8 (LTS), 5.0.5 and 5.1.3. The fix is also included in Release Candidate 1 of the forthcoming Wagtail 5.2 release. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45809", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nTorchbox\u00bbWagtailVersions  from including (>=) 5.1andbefore (<) 5.1.3cpe:2.3:a:torchbox:wagtail:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTorchbox\u00bbWagtailVersions  from including (>=) 4.2andbefore (<) 5.0.5cpe:2.3:a:torchbox:wagtail:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nTorchbox\u00bbWagtailVersions  before (<) 4.1.9cpe:2.3:a:torchbox:wagtail:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 22 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-25  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-09-18  0.05%  0.05%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-11-01  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-425 Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/425/Direct-Request-Forced-Browsing-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-532 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/532/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-into-Log-File.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/commit/bc96aed6ac53f998b2f4c4bf97e2d4f5fe337e5b", "ref_desc": "Redirect away from user bulk actions when user has no permissions on \u2026 \u00b7 wagtail/wagtail@bc96aed \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/security/advisories/GHSA-fc75-58r8-rm3h", "ref_desc": "Disclosure of user names via admin bulk action views \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 wagtail/wagtail \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
