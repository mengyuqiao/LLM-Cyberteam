{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-43643", "Description": "AntiSamy is a library for performing fast, configurable cleansing of HTML coming from untrusted sources. Prior to version 1.7.4, there is a potential for a mutation XSS (mXSS) vulnerability in AntiSamy caused by flawed parsing of the HTML being sanitized. To be subject to this vulnerability the `preserveComments` directive must be enabled in your policy file and also allow for certain tags at the same time. As a result, certain crafty inputs can result in elements in comment tags being interpreted as executable when using AntiSamy's sanitized output. This issue has been patched in AntiSamy 1.7.4 and later.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-43643", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nAntisamy Project\u00bbAntisamyVersions  before (<) 1.7.4cpe:2.3:a:antisamy_project:antisamy:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-15  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-09-08  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-10-15  0.05%  0.04%  -0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nahsra/antisamy/releases/tag/v1.7.4", "ref_desc": "Release Release version 1.7.4 \u00b7 nahsra/antisamy \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nahsra/antisamy/security/advisories/GHSA-pcf2-gh6g-h5r2", "ref_desc": "mXSS when preserving comments \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 nahsra/antisamy \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Mitigation;Product;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
