{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-45136", "Description": "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. When document names are validated according to a name strategy (disabled by default), XWiki starting in version 12.0-rc-1 and prior to versions 12.10.12 and 15.5-rc-1 is vulnerable to a reflected cross-site scripting attack in the page creation form. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary actions with the rights of the user opening the malicious link. Depending on the rights of the user, this may allow remote code execution and full read and write access to the whole XWiki installation. This has been patched in XWiki 14.10.12 and 15.5-rc-1 by adding appropriate escaping. The vulnerable template file `createinline.vm` is part of XWiki's WAR and can be patched by manually applying the changes from the fix.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45136", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  from including (>=) 12.0andbefore (<) 14.10.12cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbXwikiVersions  from including (>=) 15.0andbefore (<) 15.5cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nXwiki\u00bbXwiki\u00bbVersion:15.5UpdateRC1cpe:2.3:a:xwiki:xwiki:15.5:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "54.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 98 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-26  63.83%  54.17%  -9.66 \n 2  2024-11-13  52.51%  63.83%  +11.32 \n 3  2024-10-31  66.63%  52.51%  -14.12 \n 4  2024-10-20  63.68%  66.63%  +2.95 \n 5  2024-10-06  63.95%  63.68%  -0.27 \n 6  2024-09-24  61.76%  63.95%  +2.19 \n 7  2024-09-13  68.35%  61.76%  -6.59 \n 8  2024-08-31  80.29%  68.35%  -11.93 \n 9  2024-08-20  83.20%  80.29%  -2.92 \n 10  2024-07-28  64.51%  83.20%  +18.70 \n 11  2024-07-15  59.80%  64.51%  +4.71 \n 12  2024-06-23  53.06%  59.80%  +6.74 \n 13  2024-06-21  0.37%  53.06%  +52.69 \n 14  2023-11-03  0.06%  0.37%  +0.30 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20854", "ref_desc": "[XWIKI-20854] Reflected XSS in the create document form if name validation is enabled - XWiki.org JIRAExploit;Issue Tracking;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/ba56fda175156dd35035f2b8c86cbd8ef1f90c2e", "ref_desc": "XWIKI-20962: Escape template provider errors during document creation \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform@ba56fda \u00b7 GitHubPatchCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/qQKyksji4IsuVx5KSv-knKX84v8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-qcj9-gcpg-4w2w", "ref_desc": "Reflected XSS in the create document form if name validation is enabled \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 xwiki/xwiki-platform \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
