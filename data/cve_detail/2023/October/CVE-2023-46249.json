{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-46249", "Description": "authentik is an open-source Identity Provider. Prior to versions 2023.8.4 and 2023.10.2, when the default admin user has been deleted, it is potentially possible for an attacker to set the password of the default admin user without any authentication. authentik uses a blueprint to create the default admin user, which can also optionally set the default admin users' password from an environment variable. When the user is deleted, the `initial-setup` flow used to configure authentik after the first installation becomes available again. authentik 2023.8.4 and 2023.10.2 fix this issue. As a workaround, ensure the default admin user (Username `akadmin`) exists and has a password set. It is recommended to use a very strong password for this user, and store it in a secure location like a password manager. It is also possible to deactivate the user to prevent any logins as akadmin.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46249", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nGoauthentik\u00bbAuthentikVersions  before (<) 2023.8.4cpe:2.3:a:goauthentik:authentik:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGoauthentik\u00bbAuthentikVersions  from including (>=) 2023.10.0andbefore (<) 2023.10.2cpe:2.3:a:goauthentik:authentik:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-02  0.13%  0.15%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-11-06  0.11%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-09-30  0.10%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-11-09  0.05%  0.10%  +0.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/commit/ea75741ec22ecef34bc7073f1163e17a8a2bf9fc", "ref_desc": "security: fix oobe-flow reuse when akadmin is deleted (#7361) \u00b7 goauthentik/authentik@ea75741 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/releases/tag/version%2F2023.10.2", "ref_desc": "Release Release 2023.10.2 \u00b7 goauthentik/authentik \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/security/advisories/GHSA-rjvp-29xq-f62w", "ref_desc": "Potential Installation takeover when default admin user is deleted \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 goauthentik/authentik \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/commit/261879022d25016d58867cf1f24e90b81ad618d0", "ref_desc": "security: fix oobe-flow reuse when akadmin is deleted (#7361) \u00b7 goauthentik/authentik@2618790 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/releases/tag/version%2F2023.8.4", "ref_desc": "Release Release 2023.8.4 \u00b7 goauthentik/authentik \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
