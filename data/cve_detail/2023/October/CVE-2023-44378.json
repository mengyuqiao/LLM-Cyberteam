{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-44378", "Description": "gnark is a zk-SNARK library that offers a high-level API to design circuits. Prior to version 0.9.0, for some in-circuit values, it is possible to construct two valid decomposition to bits. In addition to the canonical decomposition of `a`, for small values there exists a second decomposition for `a+r` (where `r` is the modulus the values are being reduced by). The second decomposition was possible due to overflowing the field where the values are defined. Upgrading to version 0.9.0 should fix the issue without needing to change the calls to value comparison methods.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-44378", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nConsensys\u00bbGnarkVersions  before (<) 0.9.0cpe:2.3:a:consensys:gnark:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-10-15  0.06%  0.11%  +0.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-191 Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/191/Integer-Underflow-Wrap-or-Wraparound-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-697 Incorrect Comparison", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/697/Incorrect-Comparison.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/zkopru-network/zkopru/issues/116", "ref_desc": "LessThan(n) is unsafe with n = 254 \u00b7 Issue #116 \u00b7 zkopru-network/zkopru \u00b7 GitHubNot Applicable", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Consensys/gnark/commit/59a4087261a6c73f13e80d695c17b398c3d0934f", "ref_desc": "fix: assert that the binary decomposition of a variable is less than \u2026 \u00b7 Consensys/gnark@59a4087 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/Consensys/gnark/security/advisories/GHSA-498w-5j49-vqjg", "ref_desc": "Unsoundness in variable comparison / non-unique binary decomposition \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 Consensys/gnark \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
