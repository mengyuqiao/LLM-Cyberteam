{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-46133", "Description": "CryptoES is a cryptography algorithms library compatible with ES6 and TypeScript. Prior to version 2.1.0, CryptoES PBKDF2 is 1,000 times weaker than originally specified in 1993, and at least 1,300,000 times weaker than current industry standard. This is because it both defaults to SHA1, a cryptographic hash algorithm considered insecure since at least 2005, and defaults to one single iteration, a 'strength' or 'difficulty' value specified at 1,000 when specified in 1993. PBKDF2 relies on iteration count as a countermeasure to preimage and collision attacks. If used to protect passwords, the impact is high. If used to generate signatures, the impact is high. Version 2.1.0 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, configure CryptoES to use SHA256 with at least 250,000 iterations.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46133", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nEntronad\u00bbCryptoes\u00bbForNode.jsVersions  before (<) 2.1.0cpe:2.3:a:entronad:cryptoes:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-26  0.14%  0.15%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-10-31  0.10%  0.14%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-09-24  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-11-09  0.04%  0.09%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-327 Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/327/Use-of-a-Broken-or-Risky-Cryptographic-Algorithm.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-328 Use of Weak Hash", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/328/Use-of-Weak-Hash.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-916 Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/916/Use-of-Password-Hash-With-Insufficient-Computational-Effort.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/entronad/crypto-es/commit/d506677fae3d03a454b37ad126e0c119d416b757", "ref_desc": "v2.1.0 \u00b7 entronad/crypto-es@d506677 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/entronad/crypto-es/security/advisories/GHSA-mpj8-q39x-wq5h", "ref_desc": "crypto-es PBKDF2 1,000 times weaker than specified in 1993 and 1.3M times weaker than current standard \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 entronad/crypto-es \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
