{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-46117", "Description": "reconFTW is a tool designed to perform automated recon on a target domain by running the best set of tools to perform scanning and finding out vulnerabilities. A vulnerability has been identified in reconftw where inadequate validation of retrieved subdomains may lead to a Remote Code Execution (RCE) attack. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious CSP entry on it's own domain. Successful exploitation can lead to the execution of arbitrary code within the context of the application, potentially compromising the system. This issue has been addressed in version 2.7.1.1 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46117", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nSix2dez\u00bbReconftwVersions  before (<) 2.7.1.1cpe:2.3:a:six2dez:reconftw:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.62% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 79 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-21  0.53%  0.62%  +0.09 \n 2  2024-10-26  0.32%  0.53%  +0.21 \n 3  2024-09-19  0.28%  0.32%  +0.04 \n 4  2023-10-28  0.05%  0.28%  +0.23 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/six2dez/reconftw/commit/e639de356c0880fe5fe01a32de9d0c58afb5f086", "ref_desc": "fix regex \u00b7 six2dez/reconftw@e639de3 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/six2dez/reconftw/security/advisories/GHSA-fxwr-vr9x-wvjp", "ref_desc": "Inadequate validation of retrieved subdomains may lead to a Remote Code Execution (RCE) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 six2dez/reconftw \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
