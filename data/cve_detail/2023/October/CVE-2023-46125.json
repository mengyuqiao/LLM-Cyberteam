{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-46125", "Description": "Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform for managing the fulfillment of data privacy requests in a runtime environment, and the enforcement of privacy regulations in code. The Fides webserver API allows users to retrieve its configuration using the `GET api/v1/config` endpoint. The configuration data is filtered to suppress most sensitive configuration information before it is returned to the user, but even the filtered data contains information about the internals and the backend infrastructure, such as various settings, servers\u2019 addresses and ports and database username. This information is useful for administrative users as well as attackers, thus it should not be revealed to low-privileged users. This vulnerability allows Admin UI users with roles lower than the owner role e.g. the viewer role to retrieve the config information using the API. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.22.1`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46125", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nEthyca\u00bbFidesVersions  before (<) 2.22.1cpe:2.3:a:ethyca:fides:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-30  0.07%  0.10%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-09-23  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-11-02  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ethyca/fides/releases/tag/2.22.1", "ref_desc": "Release v2.22.1 \u00b7 ethyca/fides \u00b7 GitHubRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/8eLvDZm3rOidZ-yXTrQpKPQd3to.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ethyca/fides/security/advisories/GHSA-rjxg-rpg3-9r89", "ref_desc": "Information Disclosure Vulnerability in Config API Endpoint \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ethyca/fides \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ethyca/fides/commit/c9f3a620a4b4c1916e0941cb5624dcd636f06d06", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-rjxg-rpg3-9r89 \u00b7 ethyca/fides@c9f3a62 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
