{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-43810", "Description": "OpenTelemetry, also known as OTel for short, is a vendor-neutral open-source Observability framework for instrumenting, generating, collecting, and exporting telemetry data such as traces, metrics, logs. Autoinstrumentation out of the box adds the label `http_method` that has unbound cardinality. It leads to the server's potential memory exhaustion when many malicious requests are sent. HTTP method for requests can be easily set by an attacker to be random and long. In order to be affected program has to be instrumented for HTTP handlers and does not filter any unknown HTTP methods on the level of CDN, LB, previous middleware, etc. This issue has been patched in version 0.41b0.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-43810", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOpentelemetry\u00bbOpentelemetryVersions  before (<) 0.41b0cpe:2.3:a:opentelemetry:opentelemetry:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-07  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-12  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-09-05  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-10-12  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python-contrib/security/advisories/GHSA-5rv5-6h4r-h22v", "ref_desc": "DoS vulnerability in opentelemetry-instrumentation-{instrumentation} (uncontrolled resource consumption) - due to unbound cardinality metrics \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python-contrib \u00b7Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python-contrib/commit/6007e0c013071e7f8b9612d3bc68aeb9d600d74e", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-5rv5-6h4r-h22v \u00b7 open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python-contrib@6007e0c \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python-contrib/releases/tag/v0.41b0", "ref_desc": "Release Version 1.20.0/0.41b0 \u00b7 open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python-contrib \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
