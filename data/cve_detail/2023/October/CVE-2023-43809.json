{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-43809", "Description": "Soft Serve is a self-hostable Git server for the command line. Prior to version 0.6.2, a security vulnerability in Soft Serve could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass public key authentication when keyboard-interactive SSH authentication is active, through the `allow-keyless` setting, and the public key requires additional client-side verification for example using FIDO2 or GPG. This is due to insufficient validation procedures of the public key step during SSH request handshake, granting unauthorized access if the keyboard-interaction mode is utilized. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by presenting manipulated SSH requests using keyboard-interactive authentication mode. This could potentially result in unauthorized access to the Soft Serve. Users should upgrade to the latest Soft Serve version `v0.6.2` to receive the patch for this issue. To workaround this vulnerability without upgrading, users can temporarily disable Keyboard-Interactive SSH Authentication using the `allow-keyless` setting.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-43809", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nCharm\u00bbSoft Serve\u00bbForGOVersions  before (<) 0.6.2cpe:2.3:a:charm:soft_serve:*:*:*:*:*:go:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.37% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 73 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-05  0.33%  0.37%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-10-10  0.20%  0.33%  +0.13 \n 3  2024-09-03  0.17%  0.20%  +0.03 \n 4  2024-04-18  0.17%  0.17%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-10-11  0.07%  0.17%  +0.11 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/charmbracelet/soft-serve/commit/407c4ec72d1006cee1ff8c1775e5bcc091c2bc89", "ref_desc": "fix(ssh): add authentication middleware \u00b7 charmbracelet/soft-serve@407c4ec \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/charmbracelet/soft-serve/releases/tag/v0.6.2", "ref_desc": "Release v0.6.2 \u00b7 charmbracelet/soft-serve \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/charmbracelet/soft-serve/issues/389", "ref_desc": "Public key authentication bypass despite client-side keypair authn failure when `allow-keyless` is true \u00b7 Issue #389 \u00b7 charmbracelet/soft-serve \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/charmbracelet/soft-serve/security/advisories/GHSA-mc97-99j4-vm2v", "ref_desc": "Soft Serve Public Key Authentication Bypass Vulnerability when Keyboard-Interactive SSH Authentication is Enabled \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 charmbracelet/soft-serve \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
