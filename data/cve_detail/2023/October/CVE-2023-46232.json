{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-46232", "Description": "era-compiler-vyper is the EraVM Vyper compiler for zkSync Era, a layer 2 rollup that uses zero-knowledge proofs to scale Ethereum. Prior to era-compiler-vype version 1.3.10, a bug prevented the initialization of the first immutable variable for Vyper contracts meeting certain criteria. The problem arises when there is a String or Array with more 256-bit words allocated than initialized. It results in the second word\u2019s index unset, that is effectively set to 0, so the first immutable value with the actual 0 index is overwritten in the ImmutableSimulator. Version 1.3.10 fixes this issue by setting all indexes in advance. The problem will go away, but it will get more expensive if the user allocates a lot of uninitialized space, e.g. `String[4096]`. Upgrading and redeploying affected contracts is the only way of working around the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46232", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMatter-labs\u00bbZkvyperVersions  before (<) 1.3.10cpe:2.3:a:matter-labs:zkvyper:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-26  0.08%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-31  0.06%  0.08%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-09-24  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-11-07  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-471 Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/471/Modification-of-Assumed-Immutable-Data-MAID-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/matter-labs/era-system-contracts/blob/main/contracts/ImmutableSimulator.sol#L37", "ref_desc": "era-system-contracts/contracts/ImmutableSimulator.sol at main \u00b7 matter-labs/era-system-contracts \u00b7 GitHubProduct", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matter-labs/era-compiler-vyper/commit/8be305a1b9c68d0fd47dad3434224ed85944ca25", "ref_desc": "Release v1.3.10 \u00b7 matter-labs/era-compiler-vyper@8be305a \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/matter-labs/era-compiler-vyper/security/advisories/GHSA-h8jv-969m-94r4", "ref_desc": "First Immutable Variable Initialization \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 matter-labs/era-compiler-vyper \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
