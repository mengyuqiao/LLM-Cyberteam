{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-45823", "Description": "Artifact Hub is a web-based application that enables finding, installing, and publishing packages and configurations for CNCF projects. During a security audit of Artifact Hub's code base a security researcher identified a bug in which by using symbolic links in certain kinds of repositories loaded into Artifact Hub, it was possible to read internal files. Artifact Hub indexes content from a variety of sources, including git repositories. When processing git based repositories, Artifact Hub clones the repository and, depending on the artifact kind, reads some files from it. During this process, in some cases, no validation was done to check if the file was a symbolic link. This made possible to read arbitrary files in the system, potentially leaking sensitive information. This issue has been resolved in version `1.16.0`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45823", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nArtifacthub\u00bbHUBVersions  before (<) 1.16.0cpe:2.3:a:artifacthub:hub:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 53 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-20  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-25  0.11%  0.14%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-09-18  0.09%  0.11%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-10-31  0.04%  0.09%  +0.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/artifacthub/hub/security/advisories/GHSA-hmq4-c2r4-5q8h", "ref_desc": "Arbitrary file read \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 artifacthub/hub \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/artifact-hub/artifact-hub?modal=changelog&version=1.16.0", "ref_desc": "artifact-hub 1.16.0 \u00b7 artifacthub/artifact-hubProductCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/CQ64BDYoGCC7I4ufLTbuxF1ZDW4.html"}]}
