{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-45807", "Description": "OpenSearch is a community-driven, open source fork of Elasticsearch and Kibana following the license change in early 2021. There is an issue with the implementation of tenant permissions in OpenSearch Dashboards where authenticated users with read-only access to a tenant can perform create, edit and delete operations on index metadata of dashboards and visualizations in that tenant, potentially rendering them unavailable. This issue does not affect index data, only metadata. Dashboards correctly enforces read-only permissions when indexing and updating documents. This issue does not provide additional read access to data users don\u2019t already have. This issue can be mitigated by disabling the tenants functionality for the cluster. Versions 1.3.14 and 2.11.0 contain a fix for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45807", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAmazon\u00bbOpensearch\u00bbForMavenVersions  before (<) 1.3.14.0cpe:2.3:a:amazon:opensearch:*:*:*:*:*:maven:*:*Matching versions\nAmazon\u00bbOpensearch\u00bbForDockerVersions  before (<) 1.3.14.0cpe:2.3:a:amazon:opensearch:*:*:*:*:*:docker:*:*Matching versions\nAmazon\u00bbOpensearch\u00bbForMavenVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.11.0.0cpe:2.3:a:amazon:opensearch:*:*:*:*:*:maven:*:*Matching versions\nAmazon\u00bbOpensearch\u00bbForDockerVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.11.0.0cpe:2.3:a:amazon:opensearch:*:*:*:*:*:docker:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 30 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-22  0.05%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-09-15  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-10-21  0.04%  0.04%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-281 Improper Preservation of Permissions", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/281/Improper-Preservation-of-Permissions.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/opensearch-project/security/security/advisories/GHSA-72q2-gwwf-6hrv", "ref_desc": "OpenSearch Issue with tenant read-only permissions \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 opensearch-project/security \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
