{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-45802", "Description": "When a HTTP/2 stream was reset (RST frame) by a client, there was a time window were the request's memory resources were not reclaimed immediately. Instead, de-allocation was deferred to connection close. A client could send new requests and resets, keeping the connection busy and open and causing the memory footprint to keep on growing. On connection close, all resources were reclaimed, but the process might run out of memory before that.\n\nThis was found by the reporter during testing of\u00a0CVE-2023-44487 (HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Exploit) with their own test client. During \"normal\" HTTP/2 use, the probability to hit this bug is very low. The kept memory would not become noticeable before the connection closes or times out.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.58, which fixes the issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45802", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:10.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nApache\u00bbHttp ServerVersions  from including (>=) 2.4.17andbefore (<) 2.4.58cpe:2.3:a:apache:http_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:37cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:37:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:38cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:38:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFedoraproject\u00bbFedora\u00bbVersion:39cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:39:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-24  0.16%  0.11%  -0.05 \n 2  2024-10-29  0.06%  0.16%  +0.10 \n 3  2024-10-15  0.98%  0.06%  -0.91 \n 4  2024-10-10  0.40%  0.98%  +0.57 \n 5  2024-06-11  0.18%  0.40%  +0.23 \n 6  2023-11-07  0.09%  0.18%  +0.08 \n 7  2023-11-02  0.05%  0.09%  +0.05 \n 8  2023-10-28  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-404 Improper Resource Shutdown or Release", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/404/Improper-Resource-Shutdown-or-Release.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/05/msg00013.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 3818-1] apache2 security updateMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/-gJiqxI_XrD_JJe-IayonlZ41Fg.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/BFQD3KUEMFBHPAPBGLWQC34L4OWL5HAZ/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 38 Update: mod_http2-2.0.25-1.fc38 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing ListCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/-OLmggx6UUkC379cH4q2l2l2YS8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WE2I52RHNNU42PX6NZ2RBUHSFFJ2LVZX/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 39 Update: mod_http2-2.0.25-1.fc39 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html", "ref_desc": "httpd 2.4 vulnerabilities - The Apache HTTP Server ProjectVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/bRHJW4C-Q8TD4xU-vQxvHsw9lnk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2MBEPPC36UBVOZZNAXFHKLFGSLCMN5LI/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 37 Update: mod_http2-2.0.25-1.fc37 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsMailing List", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231027-0011/", "ref_desc": "October 2023 Apache HTTP Server Vulnerabilities in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/GV9nYU90pJ2IFRFAKxw_i75WF9U.html"}]}
