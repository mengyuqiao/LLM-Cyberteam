{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-46250", "Description": "pypdf is a free and open-source pure-python PDF library. An attacker who uses a vulnerability present in versions 3.7.0 through 3.16.4 can craft a PDF which leads to an infinite loop. This infinite loop blocks the current process and can utilize a single core of the CPU by 100%. It does not affect memory usage. That is, for example, the case when the pypdf-user manipulates an incoming malicious PDF e.g. by merging it with another PDF or by adding annotations. The issue was fixed in version 3.17.0. As a workaround, apply the patch manually by modifying `pypdf/generic/_data_structures.py`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46250", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPypdf Project\u00bbPypdfVersions  from including (>=) 3.7.0andbefore (<) 3.17.0cpe:2.3:a:pypdf_project:pypdf:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 20 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-02  0.04%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-835 Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/835/Loop-with-Unreachable-Exit-Condition-Infinite-Loop-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/commit/9b23ac3c9619492570011d551d521690de9a3e2d", "ref_desc": "SEC: Infinite recursion when using PdfWriter(clone_from=reader) (#2264) \u00b7 py-pdf/pypdf@9b23ac3 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/pull/2264", "ref_desc": "BUG: Infinite recursion when using PdfWriter(clone_from=reader) by Alexhuszagh \u00b7 Pull Request #2264 \u00b7 py-pdf/pypdf \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/security/advisories/GHSA-wjcc-cq79-p63f", "ref_desc": "Possible Infinite Loop when PdfWriter(clone_from) is used with a PDF \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 py-pdf/pypdf \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
