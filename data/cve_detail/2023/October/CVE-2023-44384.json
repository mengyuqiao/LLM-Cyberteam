{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-44384", "Description": "Discourse-jira is a Discourse plugin allows Jira projects, issue types, fields and field options will be synced automatically. An administrator user can make an SSRF attack by setting the Jira URL to an arbitrary location and enabling the `discourse_jira_verbose_log` site setting. A moderator user could manipulate the request path to the Jira API, allowing them to perform arbitrary GET requests using the Jira API credentials, potentially with elevated permissions, used by the application.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-44384", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nDiscourse\u00bbDiscourse Jira\u00bbForDiscourseVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2023-10-01cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse_jira:*:*:*:*:*:discourse:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-12  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-09-05  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-10-12  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-691 Insufficient Control Flow Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/691/Insufficient-Control-Flow-Management.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse-jira/security/advisories/GHSA-pmv5-h2x6-35fh", "ref_desc": "Possible SSRF by setting Jira URL to an arbitrary location \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 discourse/discourse-jira \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse-jira/commit/8a2d3ad228883199fd5f081cc93d173c88e2e48f", "ref_desc": "SECURITY: use `FinalDestination` to prevent SSRF attacks on API calls\u2026 \u00b7 discourse/discourse-jira@8a2d3ad \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse-jira/pull/50", "ref_desc": "SECURITY: use `FinalDestination` to prevent SSRF attacks on API calls. by vinothkannans \u00b7 Pull Request #50 \u00b7 discourse/discourse-jira \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
