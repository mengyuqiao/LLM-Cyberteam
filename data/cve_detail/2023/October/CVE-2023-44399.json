{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-44399", "Description": "ZITADEL provides identity infrastructure. In versions 2.37.2 and prior, ZITADEL administrators can enable a setting called \"Ignoring unknown usernames\" which helps mitigate attacks that try to guess/enumerate usernames. While this settings was properly working during the authentication process it did not work correctly on the password reset flow. This meant that even if this feature was active that an attacker could use the password reset function to verify if an account exist within ZITADEL. This bug has been patched in versions 2.37.3 and 2.38.0. No known workarounds are available.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-44399", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nZitadel\u00bbZitadelVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.37.2cpe:2.3:a:zitadel:zitadel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-11  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-16  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-09-09  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-10-24  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-640 Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/640/Weak-Password-Recovery-Mechanism-for-Forgotten-Password.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.37.3", "ref_desc": "Release v2.37.3 \u00b7 zitadel/zitadel \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/security/advisories/GHSA-v683-rcxx-vpff", "ref_desc": "Password reset does not respect the \"Ignoring unknown usernames\" setting \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 zitadel/zitadel \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.38.0", "ref_desc": "Release v2.38.0 \u00b7 zitadel/zitadel \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
