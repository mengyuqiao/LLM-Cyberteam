{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-46239", "Description": "quic-go is an implementation of the QUIC protocol in Go. Starting in version 0.37.0 and prior to version 0.37.3, by serializing an ACK frame after the CRYTPO that allows a node to complete the handshake, a remote node could trigger a nil pointer dereference (leading to a panic) when the node attempted to drop the Handshake packet number space. An attacker can bring down a quic-go node with very minimal effort. Completing the QUIC handshake only requires sending and receiving a few packets. Version 0.37.3 contains a patch. Versions before 0.37.0 are not affected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46239", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nQuic-go Project\u00bbQuic-goVersions  from including (>=) 0.37.0andbefore (<) 0.37.3cpe:2.3:a:quic-go_project:quic-go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-02  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-11-06  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 3  2024-09-30  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-11-09  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-248 Uncaught Exception", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/248/Uncaught-Exception.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/476/NULL-Pointer-Dereference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/security/advisories/GHSA-3q6m-v84f-6p9h", "ref_desc": "remote-triggered panic due to unexpected frame serialization order when completing the handshake \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 quic-go/quic-go \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/releases/tag/v0.37.3", "ref_desc": "Release v0.37.3 \u00b7 quic-go/quic-go \u00b7 GitHubRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/commit/b6a4725b60f1fe04e8f1ddcc3114e290fcea1617", "ref_desc": "fix handling of ACK frames serialized after CRYPTO frames (#4018) \u00b7 quic-go/quic-go@b6a4725 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
