{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-45141", "Description": "Fiber is an express inspired web framework written in Go. A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability has been identified in the application, which allows an attacker to obtain tokens and forge malicious requests on behalf of a user. This can lead to unauthorized actions being taken on the user's behalf, potentially compromising the security and integrity of the application. The vulnerability is caused by improper validation and enforcement of CSRF tokens within the application. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 2.50.0 and users are advised to upgrade. Users should take additional security measures like captchas or Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) and set Session cookies with SameSite=Lax or SameSite=Secure, and the Secure and HttpOnly attributes.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45141", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nGofiber\u00bbFiber\u00bbForGOVersions  before (<) 2.50.0cpe:2.3:a:gofiber:fiber:*:*:*:*:*:go:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-17  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-10-22  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-09-15  0.06%  0.06%  0.00 \n 4  2023-10-24  0.04%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-565 Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/565/Reliance-on-Cookies-without-Validation-and-Integrity-Checkin.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/security/advisories/GHSA-mv73-f69x-444p", "ref_desc": "CSRF Token Validation Vulnerability \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 gofiber/fiber \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
