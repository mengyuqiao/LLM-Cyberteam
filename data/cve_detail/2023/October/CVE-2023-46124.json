{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-46124", "Description": "Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform for managing the fulfillment of data privacy requests in runtime environments, and the enforcement of privacy regulations in code. The Fides web application allows a custom integration to be uploaded as a ZIP file containing configuration and dataset definitions in YAML format. It was discovered that specially crafted YAML dataset and config files allow a malicious user to perform arbitrary requests to internal systems and exfiltrate data outside the environment (also known as a Server-Side Request Forgery). The application does not perform proper validation to block attempts to connect to internal (including localhost) resources. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.22.1`.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46124", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nEthyca\u00bbFidesVersions  before (<) 2.22.1cpe:2.3:a:ethyca:fides:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-30  0.08%  0.15%  +0.06 \n 2  2024-09-23  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2024-08-30  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-11-02  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-10-26  0.05%  0.06%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ethyca/fides/commit/cd344d016b1441662a61d0759e7913e8228ed1ee", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-jq3w-9mgf-43m4 \u00b7 ethyca/fides@cd344d0 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ethyca/fides/releases/tag/2.22.1", "ref_desc": "Release v2.22.1 \u00b7 ethyca/fides \u00b7 GitHubRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/8eLvDZm3rOidZ-yXTrQpKPQd3to.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ethyca/fides/security/advisories/GHSA-jq3w-9mgf-43m4", "ref_desc": "Server-Side Request Forgery Vulnerability in Custom Integration Upload \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 ethyca/fides \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
