{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-41881", "Description": "vantage6 is privacy preserving federated learning infrastructure. When a collaboration is deleted, the linked resources (such as tasks from that collaboration) should be deleted. This is partly to manage data properly, but also to prevent a potential (but unlikely) side-effect that affects versions prior to 4.0.0, where if a collaboration with id=10 is deleted, and subsequently a new collaboration is created with id=10, the authenticated users in that collaboration could potentially see results of the deleted collaboration in some cases. Version 4.0.0 contains a patch for this issue. There are no known workarounds.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-41881", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nVantage6\u00bbVantage6Versions  before (<) 4.0.0cpe:2.3:a:vantage6:vantage6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 28 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-17  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-09-10  0.05%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-10-18  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-708 Incorrect Ownership Assignment", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/708/Incorrect-Ownership-Assignment.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/security/advisories/GHSA-rf54-7qrr-96j6", "ref_desc": "Deleting a collaboration should also delete linked resources \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 vantage6/vantage6 \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/748", "ref_desc": "Add flag whether linked resources should be deleted in delete endpoin\u2026 by bartvanb \u00b7 Pull Request #748 \u00b7 vantage6/vantage6 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/blob/0682c4288f43fee5bcc72dc448cdd99bd7e57f76/docs/release_notes.rst#400", "ref_desc": "vantage6/docs/release_notes.rst at 0682c4288f43fee5bcc72dc448cdd99bd7e57f76 \u00b7 vantage6/vantage6 \u00b7 GitHubRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/OUz1N5GDXaLTskAzDYBJ0xfINxQ.html"}]}
