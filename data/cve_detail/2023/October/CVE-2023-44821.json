{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-44821", "Description": "Gifsicle through 1.94, if deployed in a way that allows untrusted input to affect Gif_Realloc calls, might allow a denial of service (memory consumption). NOTE: this has been disputed by multiple parties because the Gifsicle code is not commonly used for unattended operation in which new input arrives for a long-running process, does not ship with functionality to link it into another application as a library, and does not have realistic use cases in which an adversary controls the entire command line.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-44821", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nLcdf\u00bbGifsicleVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.94cpe:2.3:a:lcdf:gifsicle:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 7 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-08  0.07%  0.04%  -0.03 \n 2  2023-10-25  0.09%  0.07%  -0.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-401 Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/401/Missing-Release-of-Memory-after-Effective-Lifetime.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/3WLTXJS6AIKPGVOAJ7EYC4HL3NEG6CGF/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 39 Update: gifsicle-1.95-1.fc39 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/1snQRAcqS1NHPvZskLcXKKDuzSY.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/3I6Z7VAHUYX3Q4DULJ76NFD2CIFZJYH5/", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] Fedora 38 Update: gifsicle-1.95-1.fc38 - package-announce - Fedora Mailing-ListsCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Lk2MsRje-HWI3tgzYrGT4M2VeHc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kohler/gifsicle/issues/195", "ref_desc": "Memory leak on gifsicle \u00b7 Issue #195 \u00b7 kohler/gifsicle \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kohler/gifsicle/issues/65", "ref_desc": "How To use gifsicle as a library ? \u00b7 Issue #65 \u00b7 kohler/gifsicle \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
