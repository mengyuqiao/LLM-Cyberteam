{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-45822", "Description": "Artifact Hub is a web-based application that enables finding, installing, and publishing packages and configurations for CNCF projects. During a security audit of Artifact Hub's code base a security researcher identified a bug in which a default unsafe rego built-in was allowed to be used when defining authorization policies. Artifact Hub includes a fine-grained authorization mechanism that allows organizations to define what actions can be performed by their members. It is based on customizable authorization policies that are enforced by the `Open Policy Agent`. Policies are written using `rego` and their data files are expected to be json documents. By default, `rego` allows policies to make HTTP requests, which can be abused to send requests to internal resources and forward the responses to an external entity. In the context of Artifact Hub, this capability should have been disabled. This issue has been resolved in version `1.16.0`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45822", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nArtifacthub\u00bbHUBVersions  before (<) 1.16.0cpe:2.3:a:artifacthub:hub:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-20  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-25  0.07%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-09-18  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/artifacthub/hub/security/advisories/GHSA-9pc8-m4vp-ggvf", "ref_desc": "Unsafe rego built-in allowed \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 artifacthub/hub \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/artifact-hub/artifact-hub?modal=changelog&version=1.16.0", "ref_desc": "artifact-hub 1.16.0 \u00b7 artifacthub/artifact-hubProductCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/CQ64BDYoGCC7I4ufLTbuxF1ZDW4.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/#rego", "ref_desc": "Open Policy Agent | DocumentationMitigation", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.openpolicyagent.org/", "ref_desc": "Open Policy AgentMitigation", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
