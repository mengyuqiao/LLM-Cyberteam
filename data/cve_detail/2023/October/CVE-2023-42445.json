{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-42445", "Description": "Gradle is a build tool with a focus on build automation and support for multi-language development. In some cases, when Gradle parses XML files, resolving XML external entities is not disabled. Combined with an Out Of Band XXE attack (OOB-XXE), just parsing XML can lead to exfiltration of local text files to a remote server. Gradle parses XML files for several purposes. Most of the time, Gradle parses XML files it generated or were already present locally. Only Ivy XML descriptors and Maven POM files can be fetched from remote repositories and parsed by Gradle. In Gradle 7.6.3 and 8.4, resolving XML external entities has been disabled for all use cases to protect against this vulnerability. Gradle will now refuse to parse XML files that have XML external entities.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-42445", "Vulnerability Categories": "XML external entity (XXE) injection", "Affected Products": "\nGradle\u00bbGradleVersions  before (<) 7.6.3cpe:2.3:a:gradle:gradle:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGradle\u00bbGradleVersions  from including (>=) 8.0.0andbefore (<) 8.4.0cpe:2.3:a:gradle:gradle:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-11-07  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-10-12  0.07%  0.11%  +0.04 \n 3  2024-09-05  0.06%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-11-15  0.06%  0.06%  0.00 \n 5  2023-11-11  0.07%  0.06%  -0.01 \n 6  2023-10-12  0.05%  0.07%  +0.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-611 Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/611/Improper-Restriction-of-XML-External-Entity-Reference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231110-0006/", "ref_desc": "October 2023 Gradle Vulnerabilities in NetApp Products | NetApp Product SecurityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/GK_BEgj2gCctNm716e0az4WiQlE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gradle/gradle/releases/tag/v8.4.0", "ref_desc": "Release 8.4 \u00b7 gradle/gradle \u00b7 GitHubRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/kdLjieGJazaTeRulMrvIOcza5Ms.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gradle/gradle/releases/tag/v7.6.3", "ref_desc": "Release 7.6.3 \u00b7 gradle/gradle \u00b7 GitHubRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/QXXnTdVmVtCHjFZKU1TuwxOXsAg.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gradle/gradle/security/advisories/GHSA-mrff-q8qj-xvg8", "ref_desc": "Possible local text file exfiltration by XML External entity injection \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 gradle/gradle \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
