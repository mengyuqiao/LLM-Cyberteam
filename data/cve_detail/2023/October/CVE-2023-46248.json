{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-46248", "Description": "Cody is an artificial intelligence (AI) coding assistant. The Cody AI VSCode extension versions 0.10.0 through 0.14.0 are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution under certain conditions. An attacker in control of a malicious repository could modify the Cody configuration file `.vscode/cody.json` and overwrite Cody commands. If a user with the extension installed opens this malicious repository and runs a Cody command such as /explain or /doc, this could allow arbitrary code execution on the user's machine. The vulnerability is rated as critical severity, but with low exploitability. It requires the user to have a malicious repository loaded and execute the overwritten command in VS Code. The issue is exploitable regardless of the user blocking code execution on a repository through VS Code Workspace Trust. The issue was found during a regular 3rd party penetration test. The maintainers of Cody do not have evidence of open source repositories having malicious `.vscode/cody.json` files to exploit this vulnerability. The issue is fixed in version 0.14.1 of the Cody VSCode extension. In case users can't promptly upgrade, they should not open any untrusted repositories with the Cody extension loaded.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46248", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nSourcegraph\u00bbCodyVersions  from including (>=) 0.10.0andup to, including, (<=) 0.14.0cpe:2.3:a:sourcegraph:cody:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.25% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 66 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-02  0.23%  0.25%  +0.03 \n 2  2024-11-06  0.14%  0.23%  +0.09 \n 3  2024-09-30  0.13%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-09-06  0.13%  0.13%  +0.00 \n 5  2023-11-09  0.05%  0.13%  +0.07 ", "CVSS Scores": "8.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-15 External Control of System or Configuration Setting", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/15/External-Control-of-System-or-Configuration-Setting.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/sourcegraph/cody/security/advisories/GHSA-8wmq-fwv7-xmwq", "ref_desc": "Overwrite of builtin Cody commands facilitates RCE \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 sourcegraph/cody \u00b7 GitHubVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/sourcegraph/cody/pull/1414", "ref_desc": "fix: swap custom prompts and default prompts order by abeatrix \u00b7 Pull Request #1414 \u00b7 sourcegraph/cody \u00b7 GitHubExploit", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
