{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-45128", "Description": "Fiber is an express inspired web framework written in Go. A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability has been identified in the application, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary values and forge malicious requests on behalf of a user. This vulnerability can allow an attacker to inject arbitrary values without any authentication, or perform various malicious actions on behalf of an authenticated user, potentially compromising the security and integrity of the application. The vulnerability is caused by improper validation and enforcement of CSRF tokens within the application. This issue has been addressed in version 2.50.0 and users are advised to upgrade. Users should take additional security measures like captchas or Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) and set Session cookies with SameSite=Lax or SameSite=Secure, and the Secure and HttpOnly attributes as defense in depth measures. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45128", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF);Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nGofiber\u00bbFiber\u00bbForGOVersions  before (<) 2.50.0cpe:2.3:a:gofiber:fiber:*:*:*:*:*:go:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 28 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-22  0.06%  0.06%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-09-15  0.06%  0.06%  0.00 \n 3  2023-11-17  0.08%  0.06%  -0.02 \n 4  2023-10-21  0.04%  0.08%  +0.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-565 Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/565/Reliance-on-Cookies-without-Validation-and-Integrity-Checkin.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-807 Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/807/Reliance-on-Untrusted-Inputs-in-a-Security-Decision.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/commit/8c3916dbf4ad2ed427d02c6eb63ae8b2fa8f019a", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request from GHSA-94w9-97p3-p368 \u00b7 gofiber/fiber@8c3916d \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/security/advisories/GHSA-94w9-97p3-p368", "ref_desc": "CSRF Token Injection and Reuse Vulnerability \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 gofiber/fiber \u00b7 GitHubMitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
