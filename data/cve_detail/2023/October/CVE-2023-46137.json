{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-46137", "Description": "Twisted is an event-based framework for internet applications. Prior to version 23.10.0rc1, when sending multiple HTTP requests in one TCP packet, twisted.web will process the requests asynchronously without guaranteeing the response order. If one of the endpoints is controlled by an attacker, the attacker can delay the response on purpose to manipulate the response of the second request when a victim launched two requests using HTTP pipeline. Version 23.10.0rc1 contains a patch for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46137", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nTwisted\u00bbTwistedVersions  up to, including, (<=) 22.8.0cpe:2.3:a:twisted:twisted:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 31 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-10-31  0.05%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-09-24  0.05%  0.05%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-11-03  0.04%  0.05%  +0.00 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-444 Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/444/Inconsistent-Interpretation-of-HTTP-Requests-HTTP-Request-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/twisted/twisted/security/advisories/GHSA-xc8x-vp79-p3wm", "ref_desc": "Disordered HTTP pipeline response in twisted.web \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 twisted/twisted \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
