{"CVE Code": "CVE-2023-45671", "Description": "Frigate is an open source network video recorder. Prior to version 0.13.0 Beta 3, there is a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in any API endpoints reliant on the `/<camera_name>` base path as values provided for the path are not sanitized. Exploiting this vulnerability requires the attacker to both know very specific information about a user's Frigate server and requires an authenticated user to be tricked into clicking a specially crafted link to their Frigate instance. This vulnerability could exploited by an attacker under the following circumstances: Frigate publicly exposed to the internet (even with authentication); attacker knows the address of a user's Frigate instance; attacker crafts a specialized page which links to the user's Frigate instance; attacker finds a way to get an authenticated user to visit their specialized page and click the button/link. As the reflected values included in the URL are not sanitized or escaped, this permits execution arbitrary Javascript payloads. Version 0.13.0 Beta 3 contains a patch for this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45671", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nFrigate\u00bbFrigateVersions  up to, including, (<=) 0.13.0cpe:2.3:a:frigate:frigate:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFrigate\u00bbFrigate\u00bbVersion:0.13.0UpdateBeta1cpe:2.3:a:frigate:frigate:0.13.0:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFrigate\u00bbFrigate\u00bbVersion:0.13.0UpdateBeta2cpe:2.3:a:frigate:frigate:0.13.0:beta2:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.45% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 87 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-02  1.86%  1.45%  -0.41 \n 2  2024-11-18  1.56%  1.86%  +0.30 \n 3  2024-11-05  1.62%  1.56%  -0.06 \n 4  2024-10-25  1.16%  1.62%  +0.46 \n 5  2024-10-11  1.07%  1.16%  +0.09 \n 6  2024-09-29  1.04%  1.07%  +0.03 \n 7  2024-09-05  1.23%  1.04%  -0.20 \n 8  2024-08-25  1.04%  1.23%  +0.19 \n 9  2024-08-13  1.07%  1.04%  -0.03 \n 10  2024-08-02  1.01%  1.07%  +0.07 \n 11  2024-07-20  1.92%  1.01%  -0.91 \n 12  2024-06-28  1.45%  1.92%  +0.47 \n 13  2024-06-17  0.78%  1.45%  +0.67 \n 14  2024-06-07  0.77%  0.78%  +0.01 \n 15  2024-05-25  0.92%  0.77%  -0.15 \n 16  2024-04-11  0.95%  0.92%  -0.02 \n 17  2024-02-23  0.06%  0.95%  +0.89 \n 18  2023-11-09  0.05%  0.06%  +0.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/security/advisories/GHSA-jjxc-m35j-p56f", "ref_desc": "Reflected XSS through `/<camera_name>` API endpoints (GHSL-2023-195) \u00b7 Advisory \u00b7 blakeblackshear/frigate \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2023-190_Frigate/", "ref_desc": "GHSL-2023-190: Several vulnerabilities in Frigate - CVE-2023-45672, CVE-2023-45671, CVE-2023-45670 | GitHub Security LabCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/GHsLzANUjWwA9SX4CYcMr4gwyvk.html"}]}
