It is possible that SAPSetup / NwSapSetup.exe loads system DLLs like DWMAPI.dll (located in your Syswow64 / System32 folder) from the folder the executable is in and not from the system location. The desired behavior is that system dlls are only loaded from the system folders. If a dll with the same name as the system dll is located in the same folder as the executable, this dll is loaded and code is executed.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-16690", "Vulnerability Categories": "File inclusion", "Affected Products": "\nSAP\u00bbPlant Connectivity\u00bbVersion:15.0cpe:2.3:a:sap:plant_connectivity:15.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSAP\u00bbPlant Connectivity\u00bbVersion:2.3cpe:2.3:a:sap:plant_connectivity:2.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.14%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-05-05  0.10%  0.12%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.10%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-426 Untrusted Search Path", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/426/Untrusted-Search-Path.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/102145", "ref_desc": "SAP Plant Connectivity CVE-2017-16690 DLL Loading Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2529480", "ref_desc": "SAP ONE Support Launchpad: Log OnPermissions Required", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blogs.sap.com/2017/12/12/sap-security-patch-day-december-2017/", "ref_desc": "SAP Security Patch Day \u2013 December 2017 | SAP BlogsVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/vB1msKDDS9i1Lyi3iRl8TFco79E.html"}]}
