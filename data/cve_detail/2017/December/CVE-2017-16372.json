{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-16372", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Adobe Acrobat and Reader: 2017.012.20098 and earlier versions, 2017.011.30066 and earlier versions, 2015.006.30355 and earlier versions, and 11.0.22 and earlier versions. This issue is due to untrusted pointer dereference in the JavaScript API engine. In this scenario, the JavaScript input is crafted in way that the computation results with pointer to memory locations that do not belong to the relevant process address space. The dereferencing operation is a read operation, and an attack can result with sensitive data exposure.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-16372", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nAdobe\u00bbAcrobat ReaderVersions  from including (>=) 17.0andup to, including, (<=) 17.011.30066cpe:2.3:a:adobe:acrobat_reader:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAdobe\u00bbAcrobat ReaderVersions  up to, including, (<=) 11.0.22cpe:2.3:a:adobe:acrobat_reader:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAdobe\u00bbAcrobatVersions  from including (>=) 17.0andup to, including, (<=) 17.011.30066cpe:2.3:a:adobe:acrobat:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAdobe\u00bbAcrobatVersions  up to, including, (<=) 11.0.22cpe:2.3:a:adobe:acrobat:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAdobe\u00bbAcrobat Dc\u00bb     ContinuousEditionVersions  from including (>=) -andup to, including, (<=) 17.012.20098cpe:2.3:a:adobe:acrobat_dc:*:*:*:*:continuous:*:*:*Matching versions\nAdobe\u00bbAcrobat Dc\u00bb     ClassicEditionVersions  from including (>=) 15.0andup to, including, (<=) 15.006.30355cpe:2.3:a:adobe:acrobat_dc:*:*:*:*:classic:*:*:*Matching versions\nAdobe\u00bbAcrobat Reader Dc\u00bb     ContinuousEditionVersions  from including (>=) -andup to, including, (<=) 17.012.20098cpe:2.3:a:adobe:acrobat_reader_dc:*:*:*:*:continuous:*:*:*Matching versions\nAdobe\u00bbAcrobat Reader Dc\u00bb     ClassicEditionVersions  from including (>=) 15.0andup to, including, (<=) 15.006.30355cpe:2.3:a:adobe:acrobat_reader_dc:*:*:*:*:classic:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.60% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 78 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.76%  0.60%  -0.15 \n 2  2023-09-24  1.02%  0.76%  -0.26 \n 3  2023-07-29  1.51%  1.02%  -0.49 \n 4  2023-05-02  1.69%  1.51%  -0.18 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.13%  1.69%  +0.56 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039791", "ref_desc": "Adobe Acrobat/Reader Multiple Bugs Let Remote Users Obtain Potentially Sensitive Information Disclosure, Cause Denial of Service Conditions, and Execute Arbitrary Code - SecurityTrackerThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/0u1M0fwaETKW1AEu5ydClsvIBmU.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/acrobat/apsb17-36.html", "ref_desc": "Adobe Security BulletinVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/DJgG5Mj9wMDJEIAJ0LXCWVcjJ5c.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101813", "ref_desc": "Adobe Acrobat and Reader APSB17-36 Multiple Remote Code Execution VulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/rqyjr5GPbsx-wpfCFh_3RIAl2eY.html"}]}
