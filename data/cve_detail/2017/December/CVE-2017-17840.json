{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-17840", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Open-iSCSI through 2.0.875. A local attacker can cause the iscsiuio server to abort or potentially execute code by sending messages with incorrect lengths, which (due to lack of checking) can lead to buffer overflows, and result in aborts (with overflow checking enabled) or code execution. The process_iscsid_broadcast function in iscsiuio/src/unix/iscsid_ipc.c does not validate the payload length before a write operation.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-17840", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nOpen-iscsi Project\u00bbOpen-iscsiVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.0.875cpe:2.3:a:open-iscsi_project:open-iscsi:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.10%  0.04%  -1.06 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/12/13/2", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Bugs in iscsiuioMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1072312", "ref_desc": "Bug 1072312 \u2013 VUL-0: CVE-2017-17840: open-iscsi: buffer overflow in process_iscsid_broadcast()Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
