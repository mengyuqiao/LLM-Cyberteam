{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-17877", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Valve Steam Link build 643. When the SSH daemon is enabled for local development, the device is publicly available via IPv6 TCP port 22 over the internet (with stateless address autoconfiguration) by default, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain access by guessing 24 bits of the MAC address and attempting a root login. This can be exploited in conjunction with CVE-2017-17878.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-17877", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nValvesoftware\u00bbSteam Link FirmwareVersions  before (<) 644cpe:2.3:o:valvesoftware:steam_link_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Valvesoftware\u00bbSteam Link\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.76% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 81 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-17  0.71%  0.76%  +0.06 \n 2  2024-05-24  0.59%  0.71%  +0.11 \n 3  2024-05-10  0.50%  0.59%  +0.09 \n 4  2024-04-25  0.43%  0.50%  +0.07 \n 5  2024-03-15  0.40%  0.43%  +0.04 \n 6  2024-02-09  0.76%  0.40%  -0.37 \n 7  2023-05-16  0.73%  0.76%  +0.03 \n 8  2023-05-08  0.62%  0.73%  +0.12 \n 9  2023-03-07  1.14%  0.62%  -0.52 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steamlink-sdk/issues/119", "ref_desc": "Page not found \u00b7 GitHub \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steamlink-sdk#ssh-access", "ref_desc": "GitHub - ValveSoftware/steamlink-sdkIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blogger.davidmanouchehri.com/2017/12/steam-link-security-remotely-insecure.html", "ref_desc": "RFC 3514: Steam Link Security - Remotely Insecure SSH - Part #2Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
