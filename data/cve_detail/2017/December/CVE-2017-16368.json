{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-16368", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Adobe Acrobat and Reader: 2017.012.20098 and earlier versions, 2017.011.30066 and earlier versions, 2015.006.30355 and earlier versions, and 11.0.22 and earlier versions. This vulnerability leads to a stack-based buffer overflow condition in the internal Unicode string manipulation module. It is triggered by an invalid PDF file, where a crafted Unicode string causes an out of bounds memory access of a stack allocated buffer, due to improper checks when manipulating an offset of a pointer to the buffer. Attackers can exploit the vulnerability and achieve arbitrary code execution if they can effectively control the accessible memory.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-16368", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nAdobe\u00bbAcrobat ReaderVersions  from including (>=) 17.0andup to, including, (<=) 17.011.30066cpe:2.3:a:adobe:acrobat_reader:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAdobe\u00bbAcrobat ReaderVersions  up to, including, (<=) 11.0.22cpe:2.3:a:adobe:acrobat_reader:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAdobe\u00bbAcrobatVersions  from including (>=) 17.0andup to, including, (<=) 17.011.30066cpe:2.3:a:adobe:acrobat:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAdobe\u00bbAcrobatVersions  up to, including, (<=) 11.0.22cpe:2.3:a:adobe:acrobat:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAdobe\u00bbAcrobat Dc\u00bb     ContinuousEditionVersions  from including (>=) -andup to, including, (<=) 17.012.20098cpe:2.3:a:adobe:acrobat_dc:*:*:*:*:continuous:*:*:*Matching versions\nAdobe\u00bbAcrobat Dc\u00bb     ClassicEditionVersions  from including (>=) 15.0andup to, including, (<=) 15.006.30355cpe:2.3:a:adobe:acrobat_dc:*:*:*:*:classic:*:*:*Matching versions\nAdobe\u00bbAcrobat Reader Dc\u00bb     ContinuousEditionVersions  from including (>=) -andup to, including, (<=) 17.012.20098cpe:2.3:a:adobe:acrobat_reader_dc:*:*:*:*:continuous:*:*:*Matching versions\nAdobe\u00bbAcrobat Reader Dc\u00bb     ClassicEditionVersions  from including (>=) 15.0andup to, including, (<=) 15.006.30355cpe:2.3:a:adobe:acrobat_reader_dc:*:*:*:*:classic:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 85 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  2.13%  1.15%  -0.98 \n 2  2023-11-19  2.15%  2.13%  -0.03 \n 3  2023-10-19  2.32%  2.15%  -0.17 \n 4  2023-09-24  2.91%  2.32%  -0.59 \n 5  2023-07-29  4.26%  2.91%  -1.35 \n 6  2023-06-11  4.66%  4.26%  -0.40 \n 7  2023-05-02  5.20%  4.66%  -0.54 \n 8  2023-03-07  3.18%  5.20%  +2.02 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039791", "ref_desc": "Adobe Acrobat/Reader Multiple Bugs Let Remote Users Obtain Potentially Sensitive Information Disclosure, Cause Denial of Service Conditions, and Execute Arbitrary Code - SecurityTrackerThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/0u1M0fwaETKW1AEu5ydClsvIBmU.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101816", "ref_desc": "Adobe Acrobat and Reader CVE-2017-16368 Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/acrobat/apsb17-36.html", "ref_desc": "Adobe Security BulletinVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/DJgG5Mj9wMDJEIAJ0LXCWVcjJ5c.html"}]}
