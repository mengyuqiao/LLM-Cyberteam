{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-17704", "Description": "A door-unlocking issue was discovered on Software House iStar Ultra devices through 6.5.2.20569 when used in conjunction with the IP-ACM Ethernet Door Module. The communications between the IP-ACM and the iStar Ultra is encrypted using a fixed AES key and IV. Each message is encrypted in CBC mode and restarts with the fixed IV, leading to replay attacks of entire messages. There is no authentication of messages beyond the use of the fixed AES key, so message forgery is also possible.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-17704", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSwhouse\u00bbIstar Ultra FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 6.5.2.20569cpe:2.3:o:swhouse:istar_ultra_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Swhouse\u00bbIstar Ultra\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.11%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-11-09  0.10%  0.11%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-330 Use of Insufficiently Random Values", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/330/Use-of-Insufficiently-Random-Values.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://systemoverlord.com/2017/12/18/cve-2017-17704-broken-cryptography-in-istar-ultra-ip-acm-by-software-house.html", "ref_desc": "[CVE-2017-17704] Broken Cryptography in iStar Ultra & IP ACM by Software House \u00b7 System OverlordThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
