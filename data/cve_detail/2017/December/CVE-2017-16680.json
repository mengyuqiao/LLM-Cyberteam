{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-16680", "Description": "Two potential audit log injections in SAP HANA extended application services 1.0, advanced model: 1) Certain HTTP/REST endpoints of controller service are missing user input validation which could allow unprivileged attackers to forge audit log lines. Hence the interpretation of audit log files could be hindered or misdirected. 2) User Account and Authentication writes audit logs into syslog and additionally writes the same audit entries into a log file. Entries in the log file miss escaping. Hence the interpretation of audit log files could be hindered or misdirected, while the entries in syslog are correct.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-16680", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSAP\u00bbHana Extended Application Services\u00bbVersion:1.0cpe:2.3:a:sap:hana_extended_application_services:1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 52 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.17%  0.16%  -0.02 \n 2  2023-06-14  0.16%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-05-05  0.20%  0.16%  -0.04 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.20%  -0.76 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2522510", "ref_desc": "SAP ONE Support Launchpad: Log OnPermissions Required;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/102138", "ref_desc": "SAP HANA CVE-2017-16680 Security Bypass VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blogs.sap.com/2017/12/12/sap-security-patch-day-december-2017/", "ref_desc": "SAP Security Patch Day \u2013 December 2017 | SAP BlogsIssue Tracking;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/vB1msKDDS9i1Lyi3iRl8TFco79E.html"}]}
