{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-6679", "Description": "The Cisco Umbrella Virtual Appliance Version 2.0.3 and prior contained an undocumented encrypted remote support tunnel (SSH) which auto initiated from the customer's appliance to Cisco's SSH Hubs in the Umbrella datacenters. These tunnels were primarily leveraged for remote support and allowed for authorized/authenticated personnel from the Cisco Umbrella team to access the appliance remotely and obtain full control without explicit customer approval. To address this vulnerability, the Umbrella Virtual Appliance version 2.1.0 now requires explicit customer approval before an SSH tunnel from the VA to the Cisco terminating server can be established.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-6679", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbUmbrellaVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.0.3cpe:2.3:a:cisco:umbrella:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 25 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-08-18  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.06%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.0", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://support.umbrella.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004752143-Virtual-Appliance-Vulnerability-due-to-always-on-SSH-Tunnel-RESOLVED-2017-09-15", "ref_desc": "Virtual Appliance \u2013 Vulnerability due to always-on SSH Tunnel \u2013 RESOLVED \u2013 2017-09-15 \u2013 Cisco UmbrellaThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.info-sec.ca/advisories/Cisco-Umbrella.html", "ref_desc": "Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://support.umbrella.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004154423", "ref_desc": "On-Demand Tech Support SSH Tunnel for Virtual Appliances \u2013 Cisco UmbrellaThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-umbrella-tunnel-gJw5thgE", "ref_desc": "Cisco Umbrella Virtual Appliance Undocumented Support Tunnel Vulnerability", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101567", "ref_desc": "Cisco Umbrella Virtual Appliance CVE-2017-6679 Unauthorized Access VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
