{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-17560", "Description": "An issue was discovered on Western Digital MyCloud PR4100 2.30.172 devices. The web administration component, /web/jquery/uploader/multi_uploadify.php, provides multipart upload functionality that is accessible without authentication and can be used to place a file anywhere on the device's file system. This allows an attacker the ability to upload a PHP shell onto the device and obtain arbitrary code execution as root.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-17560", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nWesterndigital\u00bbMy Cloud Pr4100 Firmware\u00bbVersion:2.30.172cpe:2.3:o:westerndigital:my_cloud_pr4100_firmware:2.30.172:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Westerndigital\u00bbMy Cloud Pr4100\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "96.81% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 100 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-24  96.91%  96.81%  -0.10 \n 2  2024-12-17  97.24%  96.91%  -0.33 \n 3  2023-11-22  97.33%  97.24%  -0.08 \n 4  2023-10-22  97.39%  97.33%  -0.07 \n 5  2023-09-27  97.38%  97.39%  +0.02 \n 6  2023-07-08  97.31%  97.38%  +0.07 \n 7  2023-06-14  97.32%  97.31%  -0.02 \n 8  2023-05-08  97.36%  97.32%  -0.03 \n 9  2023-05-05  97.36%  97.36%  -0.01 \n 10  2023-04-13  97.23%  97.36%  +0.13 \n 11  2023-03-07  78.56%  97.23%  +18.67 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/43356/", "ref_desc": "Western Digital MyCloud - 'multi_uploadify' File Upload (Metasploit)Exploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://download.exploitee.rs/file/generic/Exploiteers-DEFCON25.pdf", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/9248", "ref_desc": "Add wd_mycloud_multiupload_upload exploit by Zenofex \u00b7 Pull Request #9248 \u00b7 rapid7/metasploit-framework \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
