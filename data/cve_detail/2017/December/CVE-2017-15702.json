{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-15702", "Description": "In Apache Qpid Broker-J 0.18 through 0.32, if the broker is configured with different authentication providers on different ports one of which is an HTTP port, then the broker can be tricked by a remote unauthenticated attacker connecting to the HTTP port into using an authentication provider that was configured on a different port. The attacker still needs valid credentials with the authentication provider on the spoofed port. This becomes an issue when the spoofed port has weaker authentication protection (e.g., anonymous access, default accounts) and is normally protected by firewall rules or similar which can be circumvented by this vulnerability. AMQP ports are not affected. Versions 6.0.0 and newer are not affected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-15702", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbQpid Broker-jVersions  from including (>=) 0.18andup to, including, (<=) 0.32cpe:2.3:a:apache:qpid_broker-j:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.50% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 76 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.38%  0.50%  +0.12 \n 2  2024-07-03  0.31%  0.38%  +0.08 \n 3  2023-09-16  0.43%  0.31%  -0.13 \n 4  2023-07-08  0.31%  0.43%  +0.13 \n 5  2023-06-03  0.32%  0.31%  -0.01 \n 6  2023-04-24  0.44%  0.32%  -0.12 \n 7  2023-03-12  0.44%  0.44%  0.00 \n 8  2023-03-07  1.48%  0.44%  -1.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/59d241e30db23b8b0af26bb273f789aa1f08515d3dc1a3868d3ba090@%3Cdev.qpid.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [CVE-2017-15702] Apache Qpid Broker-J Authentication Vulnerability on HTTP Ports - Pony MailIssue Tracking;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/QPID-8039", "ref_desc": "[QPID-8039] [CVE-2017-15702] [Broker-J] HTTP Ports may be tricked into using the wrong authentication provider - ASF JIRAVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/102040", "ref_desc": "Apache Qpid Broker CVE-2017-15702 Security WeaknessThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://qpid.apache.org/cves/CVE-2017-15702.html", "ref_desc": "CVE-2017-15702 - Apache Qpid\u2122Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
