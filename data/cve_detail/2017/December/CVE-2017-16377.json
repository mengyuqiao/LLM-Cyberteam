{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-16377", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Adobe Acrobat and Reader: 2017.012.20098 and earlier versions, 2017.011.30066 and earlier versions, 2015.006.30355 and earlier versions, and 11.0.22 and earlier versions. This vulnerability is due to a computation that accesses a pointer that has not been initialized in the main DLL. In this case, a computation defines a read from an unexpected memory location. Therefore, an attacker might be able to read sensitive portions of memory.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-16377", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAdobe\u00bbAcrobat ReaderVersions  from including (>=) 17.0andup to, including, (<=) 17.011.30066cpe:2.3:a:adobe:acrobat_reader:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAdobe\u00bbAcrobat ReaderVersions  up to, including, (<=) 11.0.22cpe:2.3:a:adobe:acrobat_reader:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAdobe\u00bbAcrobatVersions  from including (>=) 17.0andup to, including, (<=) 17.011.30066cpe:2.3:a:adobe:acrobat:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAdobe\u00bbAcrobatVersions  up to, including, (<=) 11.0.22cpe:2.3:a:adobe:acrobat:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAdobe\u00bbAcrobat Dc\u00bb     ContinuousEditionVersions  from including (>=) -andup to, including, (<=) 17.012.20098cpe:2.3:a:adobe:acrobat_dc:*:*:*:*:continuous:*:*:*Matching versions\nAdobe\u00bbAcrobat Dc\u00bb     ClassicEditionVersions  from including (>=) 15.0andup to, including, (<=) 15.006.30355cpe:2.3:a:adobe:acrobat_dc:*:*:*:*:classic:*:*:*Matching versions\nAdobe\u00bbAcrobat Reader Dc\u00bb     ContinuousEditionVersions  from including (>=) -andup to, including, (<=) 17.012.20098cpe:2.3:a:adobe:acrobat_reader_dc:*:*:*:*:continuous:*:*:*Matching versions\nAdobe\u00bbAcrobat Reader Dc\u00bb     ClassicEditionVersions  from including (>=) 15.0andup to, including, (<=) 15.006.30355cpe:2.3:a:adobe:acrobat_reader_dc:*:*:*:*:classic:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.66% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 79 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.83%  0.66%  -0.17 \n 2  2023-09-24  1.11%  0.83%  -0.28 \n 3  2023-07-29  1.65%  1.11%  -0.53 \n 4  2023-05-02  1.85%  1.65%  -0.20 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.13%  1.85%  +0.72 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-824 Access of Uninitialized Pointer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/824/Access-of-Uninitialized-Pointer.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039791", "ref_desc": "Adobe Acrobat/Reader Multiple Bugs Let Remote Users Obtain Potentially Sensitive Information Disclosure, Cause Denial of Service Conditions, and Execute Arbitrary Code - SecurityTrackerThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/0u1M0fwaETKW1AEu5ydClsvIBmU.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/acrobat/apsb17-36.html", "ref_desc": "Adobe Security BulletinVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/DJgG5Mj9wMDJEIAJ0LXCWVcjJ5c.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101821", "ref_desc": "Adobe Acrobat and Reader APSB17-36 Multiple Remote Code Execution VulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/RoOWbo0mKlIdNwp7tghZiolKJSc.html"}]}
