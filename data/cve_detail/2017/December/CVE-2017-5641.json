{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-5641", "Description": "Previous versions of Apache Flex BlazeDS (4.7.2 and earlier) did not restrict which types were allowed for AMF(X) object deserialization by default. During the deserialization process code is executed that for several known types has undesired side-effects. Other, unknown types may also exhibit such behaviors. One vector in the Java standard library exists that allows an attacker to trigger possibly further exploitable Java deserialization of untrusted data. Other known vectors in third party libraries can be used to trigger remote code execution.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5641", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nHP\u00bbXp Command View Advanced EditionVersions  before (<) 8.5.3-00cpe:2.3:a:hp:xp_command_view_advanced_edition:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nApache\u00bbFlex BlazedsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.7.2cpe:2.3:a:apache:flex_blazeds:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "40.99% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 97 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  7.44%  40.99%  +33.55 \n 2  2024-09-17  9.81%  7.44%  -2.37 \n 3  2024-05-19  7.44%  9.81%  +2.37 \n 4  2023-12-08  6.19%  7.44%  +1.25 \n 5  2023-11-08  6.64%  6.19%  -0.45 \n 6  2023-11-07  3.97%  6.64%  +2.67 \n 7  2023-06-30  4.80%  3.97%  -0.83 \n 8  2023-05-21  6.64%  4.80%  -1.84 \n 9  2023-03-07  15.58%  6.64%  -8.95 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-22-507/", "ref_desc": "ZDI-22-507 | Zero Day InitiativeThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-22-506/", "ref_desc": "ZDI-22-506 | Zero Day InitiativeThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1038273", "ref_desc": "VMware vCenter Server AMF3 Message Deserialization Bug Lets Remote Users Execute Arbitrary Code on the Target System - SecurityTrackerBroken Link", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://support.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docLocale=en_US&docId=emr_na-hpesbhf03823en_us", "ref_desc": "HPESBHF03823 rev.1 - HPE XP Command View Advanced Edition Software (CVAE), Remote Arbitrary Code ExecutionThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/97383", "ref_desc": "Apache Flex BlazeDS CVE-2017-5641 Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityBroken Link", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/307983", "ref_desc": "VU#307983 - Action Message Format (AMF3) Java implementations are vulnerable to insecure deserialization and XML external entities referencesThird Party Advisory;US Government ResourceCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/pm1GcRmcK7s9lH4eDQogoR-WZsk.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/flex-dev/201703.mbox/%3C6B86C8D0-6E36-48F5-AC81-4AB3978F6746@c-ware.de%3E", "ref_desc": "[VOTE] Release Apache Flex BlazeDS 4.7.3Mailing List;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLEX-35290", "ref_desc": "[FLEX-35290] Deserialization of Untrusted Data via Externalizable.readExternal - ASF JIRAIssue Tracking;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
