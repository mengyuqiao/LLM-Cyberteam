{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-17518", "Description": "swt/motif/browser.c in White_dune (aka whitedune) 0.30.10 does not validate strings before launching the program specified by the BROWSER environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to conduct argument-injection attacks via a crafted URL. NOTE: This issue is being disputed as not being a vulnerability because \u201cthe current version of white_dune (1.369 at https://wdune.ourproject.org/) do not use a \"BROWSER environment variable\". Instead, the \"browser\" variable is read from the $HOME/.dunerc file (or from the M$Windows registry). It is configurable in the \"options\" menu. The default is chosen in the ./configure script, which tests various programs, first tested is \"xdg-open\".", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-17518", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nWhite Dune Project\u00bbWhite Dune\u00bbVersion:0.30.10cpe:2.3:a:white_dune_project:white_dune:0.30.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 61 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.24%  0.24%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-08-26  0.24%  0.24%  -0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.24%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17518", "ref_desc": "CVE-2017-17518Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
