{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-17051", "Description": "An issue was discovered in the default FilterScheduler in OpenStack Nova 16.0.3. By repeatedly rebuilding an instance with new images, an authenticated user may consume untracked resources on a hypervisor host leading to a denial of service, aka doubled resource allocations. This regression was introduced with the fix for OSSA-2017-005 (CVE-2017-16239); however, only Nova stable/pike or later deployments with that fix applied and relying on the default FilterScheduler are affected.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-17051", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nOpenstack\u00bbNova\u00bbVersion:16.0.3cpe:2.3:a:openstack:nova:16.0.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.67% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 80 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.65%  0.67%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-06-07  0.76%  0.65%  -0.11 \n 3  2023-04-28  1.12%  0.76%  -0.36 \n 4  2023-03-16  1.13%  1.12%  0.00 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.02%  1.13%  +0.11 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://review.openstack.org/523214", "ref_desc": "Change I8a9157bc: Fix doubling allocations on rebuild | review.opendev Code ReviewVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.openstack.org/ossa/OSSA-2017-006.html", "ref_desc": "OpenStack Docs: OSSA-2017-006: Nova FilterScheduler doubles resource allocations during rebuild with new imageVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/102102", "ref_desc": "OpenStack Nova CVE-2017-17051 Incomplete Fix Denial of Service VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://review.openstack.org/521662", "ref_desc": "Change I8a9157bc: Fix doubling allocations on rebuild | review.opendev Code ReviewVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://launchpad.net/bugs/1732976", "ref_desc": "Bug #1732976 \u201c[OSSA-2017-006] Potential DoS by rebuilding the sa...\u201d : Bugs : OpenStack Compute (nova)Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
