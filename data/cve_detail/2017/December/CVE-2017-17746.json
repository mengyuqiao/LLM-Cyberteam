{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-17746", "Description": "Weak access control methods on the TP-Link TL-SG108E 1.0.0 allow any user on a NAT network with an authenticated administrator to access the device without entering user credentials. The authentication record is stored on the device; thus if an administrator authenticates from a NAT network, the authentication applies to the IP address of the NAT gateway, and any user behind that NAT gateway is also treated as authenticated.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-17746", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nTp-link\u00bbTl-sg108e Firmware\u00bbVersion:1.0.0cpe:2.3:o:tp-link:tl-sg108e_firmware:1.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Tp-link\u00bbTl-sg108e\u00bbVersion:1.0When used together with:Tp-link\u00bbTl-sg108e\u00bbVersion:2.0When used together with:Tp-link\u00bbTl-sg108e\u00bbVersion:3.0", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.7", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/306/Missing-Authentication-for-Critical-Function.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Dec/67", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: Multiple Vulnerabilities in TP-Link TL-SG108E - CVE-2017-17745, CVE-2017-17746, CVE-2017-17747Exploit;Mailing List;Mitigation;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/w4zU7zC4Wqk2VzTGOHfcs4-Lf70.html"}]}
