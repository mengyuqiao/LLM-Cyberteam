{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-17436", "Description": "An issue was discovered in the software on Vaultek Gun Safe VT20i products. There is no encryption of the session between the Android application and the safe. The website and marketing materials advertise that this communication channel is encrypted with \"Highest Level Bluetooth Encryption\" and \"Data transmissions are secure via AES256 bit encryption.\" These claims, however, are not true. Moreover, AES256 bit encryption is not supported in the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) standard, so it would have to be at the application level. This lack of encryption allows an individual to learn the passcode by eavesdropping on the communications between the application and the safe.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-17436", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nVaulteksafe\u00bbVt20i Firmware\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:vaulteksafe:vt20i_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Vaulteksafe\u00bbVt20i\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 28 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-326 Inadequate Encryption Strength", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/326/Inadequate-Encryption-Strength.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.twosixlabs.com/bluesteal-popping-gatt-safes/", "ref_desc": "BlueSteal: Popping GATT Safes - Two Six Labs | Advanced Analytics, Cyber Capabilities, Tactical Mobility Solutions for National SecurityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/RZ5RWE28sk88QrSER-5CYiSr968.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://vaulteksafe.com/index.php/cve-2017-17435/", "ref_desc": "VAULTEK\u00ae VT20i SECURITY UPDATE 2 \u2013 Vaultek SafeMitigation;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/voLULN8I5Hn-ixqicGb7WLRhxu8.html"}]}
