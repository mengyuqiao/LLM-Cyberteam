{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-17056", "Description": "The ZKTime Web Software 2.0.1.12280 allows the Administrator to elevate the privileges of the application user using a 'password_change()' function of the Modify Password component, reachable via the old_password, new_password1, and new_password2 parameters to the /accounts/password_change/ URI. An attacker takes advantage of this scenario and creates a crafted CSRF link to add himself as an administrator to the ZKTime Web Software. He then uses social engineering methods to trick the administrator into clicking the forged HTTP request. The request is executed and the attacker becomes the Administrator of the ZKTime Web Software. If the vulnerability is successfully exploited, then an attacker (who would be a normal user of the web application) can escalate his privileges and become the administrator of ZKTime Web Software.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-17056", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nZkteco\u00bbZktime Web\u00bbVersion:2.0.1.12280cpe:2.3:a:zkteco:zktime_web:2.0.1.12280:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.22% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.22%  0.22%  0.00 \n 2  2023-09-19  0.26%  0.22%  -0.04 \n 3  2023-05-08  0.32%  0.26%  -0.06 \n 4  2023-04-27  0.32%  0.32%  -0.01 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.32%  -0.56 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/102007", "ref_desc": "ZKTeco ZKTime Web CVE-2017-17056 Cross Site Request Forgery VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/145160/ZKTeco-ZKTime-Web-2.0.1.12280-Cross-Site-Request-Forgery.html", "ref_desc": "ZKTeco ZKTime Web 2.0.1.12280 Cross Site Request Forgery \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
