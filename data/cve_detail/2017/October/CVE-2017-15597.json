{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-15597", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.9.x. Grant copying code made an implication that any grant pin would be accompanied by a suitable page reference. Other portions of code, however, did not match up with that assumption. When such a grant copy operation is being done on a grant of a dying domain, the assumption turns out wrong. A malicious guest administrator can cause hypervisor memory corruption, most likely resulting in host crash and a Denial of Service. Privilege escalation and information leaks cannot be ruled out.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-15597", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption;Gain privilege;Denial of service;Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nXEN\u00bbXEN\u00bbUpdateRC7Versions  up to, including, (<=) 4.9.0cpe:2.3:o:xen:xen:*:rc7:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 58 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.24%  0.21%  -0.03 \n 2  2023-03-23  0.28%  0.24%  -0.05 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.03%  0.28%  -0.75 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX229057", "ref_desc": "Citrix XenServer Security Update for CVE-2017-15597Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039653", "ref_desc": "Xen Grant Copy Race Condition Lets Local Administrative Users on a Guest System Cause the Host System to Crash - SecurityTrackerIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-236.html", "ref_desc": "XSA-236 - Xen Security AdvisoriesIssue Tracking;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/10/24/3", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Xen Security Advisory 236 (CVE-2017-15597) - pin count / page reference race in grant table codeIssue Tracking;Mailing List;Mitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-4050", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-4050-1 xenCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/QeNUbor-_ZE4XrjM7o926bs7WsE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/10/msg00009.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 1549-1] xen security updateCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/QGLxPAEQCDQB0usnV9IA7Y-CGfA.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101564", "ref_desc": "Xen CVE-2017-15597 Memory Corruption VulnerabilityIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
