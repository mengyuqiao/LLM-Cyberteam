{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-1000093", "Description": "Poll SCM Plugin was not requiring requests to its API be sent via POST, thereby opening itself to Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks. This allowed attackers to initiate polling of projects with a known name. While Jenkins in general does not consider polling to be a protection-worthy action as it's similar to cache invalidation, the plugin specifically adds a permission to be able to use this functionality, and this issue undermines that permission.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-1000093", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nJenkins\u00bbPoll Scm\u00bbForJenkinsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.3.1cpe:2.3:a:jenkins:poll_scm:*:*:*:*:*:jenkins:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 35 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-16  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2017-07-10/", "ref_desc": "Jenkins Security Advisory 2017-07-10Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/QzU0PrAI7toBqG8b3ArUrLaxItA.html"}]}
