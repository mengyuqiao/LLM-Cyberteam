{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-15366", "Description": "Before Thornberry NDoc version 8.0, laptop clients and the server have default database (Cache) users set up with a single password. This password is left behind in a cleartext log file during client installation on laptops. This password can be used to gain full admin/system access to client devices (if no firewall is present) or the NDoc server itself. Once the password is known to an attacker, local access is not required.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-15366", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNdocsoftware\u00bbNdocVersions  up to, including, (<=) 7.4cpe:2.3:a:ndocsoftware:ndoc:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.22% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.18%  0.22%  +0.04 \n 2  2024-07-08  0.19%  0.18%  0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.19%  -0.70 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-532 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/532/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-into-Log-File.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://gist.github.com/emptythevoid/84248daccce8737f1cdd5b395cf6f32c", "ref_desc": "CVE-2017-15366 \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
