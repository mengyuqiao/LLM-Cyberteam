{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-4925", "Description": "Receipt of a specifically malformed IPv6 packet processed by the router may trigger a line card reset: processor exception 0x68616c74 (halt) in task: scheduler. The line card will reboot and recover without user interaction. However, additional specifically malformed packets may cause follow-on line card resets and lead to an extended service outage. This issue only affects E Series routers with IPv6 licensed and enabled. Routers not configured to process IPv6 traffic are unaffected by this vulnerability. Juniper SIRT is not aware of any malicious exploitation of this vulnerability. No other Juniper Networks products or platforms are affected by this issue.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-4925", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nJuniper\u00bbJunoseVersions  from including (>=) 10.3andup to, including, (<=) 10.3.3cpe:2.3:o:juniper:junose:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nJuniper\u00bbJunoseVersions  from including (>=) 12.3.0andup to, including, (<=) 12.3.3cpe:2.3:o:juniper:junose:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nJuniper\u00bbJunoseVersions  from including (>=) 14.3.0andup to, including, (<=) 14.3.1cpe:2.3:o:juniper:junose:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nJuniper\u00bbJunoseVersions  from including (>=) 13.3.0andup to, including, (<=) 13.3.3cpe:2.3:o:juniper:junose:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.25% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 64 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.31%  0.25%  -0.06 \n 2  2023-06-02  0.37%  0.31%  -0.06 \n 3  2023-04-15  0.35%  0.37%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.35%  -0.60 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-19", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/19/cwe.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/93533", "ref_desc": "Juniper JunosE CVE-2016-4925 Denial of Service VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1037012", "ref_desc": "Juniper JUNOSe IPv6 Processing Flaw Lets Remote Users Cause the Target Line Card to Restart - SecurityTrackerThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://kb.juniper.net/JSA10767", "ref_desc": "Juniper Networks - 2016-10 Security Bulletin: JUNOSe: Line Card Reset: processor exception 0x68616c74 (halt) task: scheduler, upon receipt of crafted IPv6 packet (CVE-2016-4925)Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
