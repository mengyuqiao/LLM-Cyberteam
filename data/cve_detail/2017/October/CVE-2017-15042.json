{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-15042", "Description": "An unintended cleartext issue exists in Go before 1.8.4 and 1.9.x before 1.9.1. RFC 4954 requires that, during SMTP, the PLAIN auth scheme must only be used on network connections secured with TLS. The original implementation of smtp.PlainAuth in Go 1.0 enforced this requirement, and it was documented to do so. In 2013, upstream issue #5184, this was changed so that the server may decide whether PLAIN is acceptable. The result is that if you set up a man-in-the-middle SMTP server that doesn't advertise STARTTLS and does advertise that PLAIN auth is OK, the smtp.PlainAuth implementation sends the username and password.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-15042", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGolang\u00bbGOVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.8.3cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGolang\u00bbGO\u00bbVersion:1.9cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.28% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 68 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.29%  0.28%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-05-08  0.42%  0.29%  -0.14 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.18%  0.42%  -0.76 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-319 Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/319/Cleartext-Transmission-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:0878", "ref_desc": "RHSA-2018:0878 - Security Advisory - Red Hat Customer PortalCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/2WWTgH4Zvg7sIUxS6jUgZHXjdpw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-dev/RinSE3EiJBI/kYL7zb07AgAJ", "ref_desc": "[security] Go 1.8.4 and Go 1.9.1 are released - Google GroepenMailing List;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/88SCSrAV6ZUyjxq4-Nsvw8oklmc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/golang/go/issues/22134", "ref_desc": "smtp.PlainAuth susceptible to man-in-the-middle password harvesting [Go 1.8] \u00b7 Issue #22134 \u00b7 golang/go \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://golang.org/cl/68023", "ref_desc": "Issue Tracking;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201710-23", "ref_desc": "Go: Multiple vulnerabilities (GLSA 201710-23) \u2014 Gentoo securityThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/H325nhbwtFPn0Zw9xivcIwVNoI0.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101197", "ref_desc": "Golang Go CVE-2017-15042 Man in the Middle Information Disclosure VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://golang.org/cl/68210", "ref_desc": "Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:3463", "ref_desc": "RHSA-2017:3463 - Security Advisory - Red Hat Customer PortalCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/YrrvHKXg0o3UfWQhpakYL2a2Nko.html"}]}
