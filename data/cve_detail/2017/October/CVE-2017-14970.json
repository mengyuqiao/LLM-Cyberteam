{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-14970", "Description": "In lib/ofp-util.c in Open vSwitch (OvS) before 2.8.1, there are multiple memory leaks while parsing malformed OpenFlow group mod messages. NOTE: the vendor disputes the relevance of this report, stating \"it can only be triggered by an OpenFlow controller, but OpenFlow controllers have much more direct and powerful ways to force Open vSwitch to allocate memory, such as by inserting flows into the flow table.\"", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-14970", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOpenvswitch\u00bbOpenvswitchVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.8.0cpe:2.3:a:openvswitch:openvswitch:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-08-11  0.11%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-05-08  0.16%  0.11%  -0.05 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.16%  -0.73 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-772 Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/772/Missing-Release-of-Resource-after-Effective-Lifetime.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://mail.openvswitch.org/pipermail/ovs-dev/2017-September/339085.html", "ref_desc": "[ovs-dev] [PATCH v4 2/3] ofp-util: Fix memory leaks on error cases in ofputil_decode_group_mod().Mailing List;Vendor Advisory;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://mail.openvswitch.org/pipermail/ovs-dev/2017-September/339086.html", "ref_desc": "[ovs-dev] [PATCH v4 3/3] ofp-util: Fix memory leaks when parsing OF1.5 group properties.Mailing List;Patch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
