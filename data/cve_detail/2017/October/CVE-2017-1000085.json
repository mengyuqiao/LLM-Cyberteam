{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-1000085", "Description": "Subversion Plugin connects to a user-specified Subversion repository as part of form validation (e.g. to retrieve a list of tags). This functionality improperly checked permissions, allowing any user with Item/Build permission (but not Item/Configure) to connect to any web server or Subversion server and send credentials with a known ID, thereby possibly capturing them. Additionally, this functionality did not require POST requests be used, thereby allowing the above to be performed without direct access to Jenkins via Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-1000085", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nJenkins\u00bbSubversion\u00bbForJenkinsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.8cpe:2.3:a:jenkins:subversion:*:*:*:*:*:jenkins:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 35 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.06%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/99574", "ref_desc": "Jenkins Subversion Plugin CVE-2017-1000085 Cross Site Request Forgery VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2017-07-10/", "ref_desc": "Jenkins Security Advisory 2017-07-10Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/QzU0PrAI7toBqG8b3ArUrLaxItA.html"}]}
