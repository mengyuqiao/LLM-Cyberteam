{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-7411", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Enalean Tuleap 9.6 and prior versions. The vulnerability exists because the User::getRecentElements() method is using the unserialize() function with a preference value that can be arbitrarily manipulated by malicious users through the REST API interface, and this can be exploited to inject arbitrary PHP objects into the application scope, allowing an attacker to perform a variety of attacks (including but not limited to Remote Code Execution).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-7411", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nEnalean\u00bbTuleapVersions  up to, including, (<=) 9.6cpe:2.3:a:enalean:tuleap:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "44.16% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 97 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-22  44.41%  44.16%  -0.26 \n 2  2024-12-17  70.83%  44.41%  -26.41 \n 3  2024-11-11  69.11%  70.83%  +1.72 \n 4  2024-02-03  70.55%  69.11%  -1.45 \n 5  2023-10-10  59.61%  70.55%  +10.94 \n 6  2023-09-09  54.86%  59.61%  +4.75 \n 7  2023-06-19  41.77%  54.86%  +13.09 \n 8  2023-05-26  39.44%  41.77%  +2.34 \n 9  2023-05-08  42.75%  39.44%  -3.32 \n 10  2023-04-13  41.83%  42.75%  +0.92 \n 11  2023-03-23  42.16%  41.83%  -0.33 \n 12  2023-03-07  60.89%  42.16%  -18.74 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/144716/Tuleap-9.6-Second-Order-PHP-Object-Injection.html", "ref_desc": "Tuleap 9.6 Second-Order PHP Object Injection \u2248 Packet StormIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tuleap.net/plugins/tracker/?aid=10118", "ref_desc": "request #10118 - Requests - TuleapExploit;Issue Tracking;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/43374/", "ref_desc": "Tuleap 9.6 - Second-Order PHP Object Injection (Metasploit)", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/10/23/3", "ref_desc": "oss-security - [KIS-2017-02] Tuleap <= 9.6 Second-Order PHP Object Injection VulnerabilityIssue Tracking;Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Oct/53", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: [KIS-2017-02] Tuleap <= 9.6 Second-Order PHP Object Injection VulnerabilityIssue Tracking;Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://karmainsecurity.com/KIS-2017-02", "ref_desc": "Tuleap <= 9.6 Second-Order PHP Object Injection Vulnerability | Karma(In)SecurityIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
