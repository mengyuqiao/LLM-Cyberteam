{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-12270", "Description": "A vulnerability in the gRPC code of Cisco IOS XR Software for Cisco Network Convergence System (NCS) 5500 Series Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition when the emsd service stops. The vulnerability is due to the software's inability to process HTTP/2 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed HTTP/2 frame to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to create a DoS condition when the emsd service stops.
