{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-10607", "Description": "Juniper Networks Junos OS 16.1R1, and services releases based off of 16.1R1, are vulnerable to the receipt of a crafted BGP Protocol Data Unit (PDU) sent directly to the router, which can cause the RPD routing process to crash and restart. Unlike BGP UPDATEs, which are transitive in nature, this issue can only be triggered by a packet sent directly to the IP address of the router. Repeated crashes of the rpd daemon can result in an extended denial of service condition. This issue only affects devices running Junos OS 16.1R1 and services releases based off of 16.1R1 (e.g. 16.1R1-S1, 16.1R1-S2, 16.1R1-S3). No prior versions of Junos OS are affected by this vulnerability, and this issue was resolved in Junos OS 16.2 prior to 16.2R1. No other Juniper Networks products or platforms are affected by this issue. This issue was found during internal product security testing.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-10607", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nJuniper\u00bbJunos\u00bbVersion:16.1cpe:2.3:o:juniper:junos:16.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nJuniper\u00bbJunos\u00bbVersion:16.1UpdateR1cpe:2.3:o:juniper:junos:16.1:r1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 46 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-06-23  0.11%  0.12%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-08-23  0.10%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-05-08  0.12%  0.10%  -0.02 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.12%  -0.76 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://kb.juniper.net/JSA10810", "ref_desc": "Juniper Networks - 2017-10 Security Bulletin: Junos: rpd core due to receipt of specially crafted BGP packet (CVE-2017-10607)Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
