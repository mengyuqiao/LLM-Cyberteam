{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-1000114", "Description": "The Datadog Plugin stores an API key to access the Datadog service in the global Jenkins configuration. While the API key is stored encrypted on disk, it was transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form. This could result in exposure of the API key for example through browser extensions or cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. The Datadog Plugin now encrypts the API key transmitted to administrators viewing the global configuration form.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-1000114", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS);Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nJenkins\u00bbDatadog\u00bbForJenkinsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 0.5.6cpe:2.3:a:jenkins:datadog:*:*:*:*:*:jenkins:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 34 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.07%  0.00 \n 2  2023-08-13  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/100223", "ref_desc": "Jenkins Datadog Plugin CVE-2017-1000114 Information Disclosure VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2017-08-07/", "ref_desc": "Jenkins Security Advisory 2017-08-07Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ulZoO6k2Ada-lkeuJuhMELZCFxM.html"}]}
