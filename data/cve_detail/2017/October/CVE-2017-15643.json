{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-15643", "Description": "An active network attacker (MiTM) can achieve remote code execution on a machine that runs IKARUS Anti Virus 2.16.7. IKARUS AV for Windows uses cleartext HTTP for updates along with a CRC32 checksum and an update value for verification of the downloaded files. The attacker first forces the client to initiate an update transaction by modifying an update field within an HTTP 200 response, so that it refers to a nonexistent update. The attacker then modifies the HTTP 404 response so that it specifies a successfully found update, with a Trojan horse executable file (e.g., guardxup.exe) and the correct CRC32 checksum for that file.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-15643", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nIkarussecurity\u00bbIkarus Antivirus\u00bbVersion:2.16.7cpe:2.3:a:ikarussecurity:ikarus_antivirus:2.16.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.41% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 74 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  2.18%  0.41%  -1.77 \n 2  2024-09-17  0.36%  2.18%  +1.82 \n 3  2024-04-25  0.30%  0.36%  +0.07 \n 4  2024-03-28  0.29%  0.30%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-02-09  1.98%  0.29%  -1.69 \n 6  2024-01-23  0.96%  1.98%  +1.02 \n 7  2023-11-05  0.82%  0.96%  +0.14 \n 8  2023-09-29  1.25%  0.82%  -0.44 \n 9  2023-08-29  0.60%  1.25%  +0.65 \n 10  2023-03-07  5.04%  0.60%  -4.44 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-444 Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/444/Inconsistent-Interpretation-of-HTTP-Requests-HTTP-Request-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.ikarussecurity.com/about-ikarus/security-blog/vulnerability-in-windows-antivirus-products-ik-sa-2017-0001/", "ref_desc": "Vulnerability in windows antivirus products (IK-SA-2017-0001) - IKARUS Security SoftwareVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/3485", "ref_desc": "SSD Advisory \u2013 Ikraus Anti Virus Remote Code Execution - SSD Secure DisclosureExploit;Technical Description;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
