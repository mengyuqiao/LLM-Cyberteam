{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-1000099", "Description": "When asking to get a file from a file:// URL, libcurl provides a feature that outputs meta-data about the file using HTTP-like headers. The code doing this would send the wrong buffer to the user (stdout or the application's provide callback), which could lead to other private data from the heap to get inadvertently displayed. The wrong buffer was an uninitialized memory area allocated on the heap and if it turned out to not contain any zero byte, it would continue and display the data following that buffer in memory.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-1000099", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nHaxx\u00bbLibcurl\u00bbVersion:7.54.1cpe:2.3:a:haxx:libcurl:7.54.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 64 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.22%  0.24%  +0.03 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.22%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://curl.haxx.se/0809C.patch", "ref_desc": "curl: page not foundPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201709-14", "ref_desc": "cURL: Multiple vulnerabilities (GLSA 201709-14) \u2014 Gentoo securityPatch;Third Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/CfKi2k5LmoczMFqG8HeQ2xeSeRs.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20170809C.html", "ref_desc": "curl - FILE buffer read out of bounds - CVE-2017-1000099Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039119", "ref_desc": "cURL 'file://' URL Processing Bug Lets Local Users View Portions of System Memory on the Target System - SecurityTrackerThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/100281", "ref_desc": "Curl CVE-2017-1000099 Local Information Disclosure VulnerabilityVDB Entry;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
