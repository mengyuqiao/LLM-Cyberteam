{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-1000255", "Description": "On Linux running on PowerPC hardware (Power8 or later) a user process can craft a signal frame and then do a sigreturn so that the kernel will take an exception (interrupt), and use the r1 value *from the signal frame* as the kernel stack pointer. As part of the exception entry the content of the signal frame is written to the kernel stack, allowing an attacker to overwrite arbitrary locations with arbitrary values. The exception handling does produce an oops, and a panic if panic_on_oops=1, but only after kernel memory has been over written. This flaw was introduced in commit: \"5d176f751ee3 (powerpc: tm: Enable transactional memory (TM) lazily for userspace)\" which was merged upstream into v4.9-rc1. Please note that kernels built with CONFIG_PPC_TRANSACTIONAL_MEM=n are not vulnerable.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-1000255", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nLinux\u00bbLinux Kernel\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:IBM\u00bbPowerpc Power8\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:IBM\u00bbPowerpc Power9\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 18 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-1000255", "ref_desc": "CVE-2017-1000255 - Red Hat Customer PortalIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:0654", "ref_desc": "RHSA-2018:0654 - Security Advisory - Red Hat Customer PortalCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/vjvXy5YgajtZu8kl7mrxH1yvyNE.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101264", "ref_desc": "Linux Kernel CVE-2017-1000255 Local Memory Corruption VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
