{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-1000257", "Description": "An IMAP FETCH response line indicates the size of the returned data, in number of bytes. When that response says the data is zero bytes, libcurl would pass on that (non-existing) data with a pointer and the size (zero) to the deliver-data function. libcurl's deliver-data function treats zero as a magic number and invokes strlen() on the data to figure out the length. The strlen() is called on a heap based buffer that might not be zero terminated so libcurl might read beyond the end of it into whatever memory lies after (or just crash) and then deliver that to the application as if it was actually downloaded.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-1000257", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:8.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:9.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nHaxx\u00bbLibcurlVersions  from including (>=) 7.20.0andup to, including, (<=) 7.56.0cpe:2.3:a:haxx:libcurl:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.89% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 88 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  2.19%  1.89%  -0.30 \n 2  2023-06-20  2.59%  2.19%  -0.40 \n 3  2023-05-27  2.83%  2.59%  -0.24 \n 4  2023-05-03  4.61%  2.83%  -1.78 \n 5  2023-03-24  7.39%  4.61%  -2.77 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.18%  7.39%  +6.20 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20171023.html", "ref_desc": "curl - IMAP FETCH response out of bounds read - CVE-2017-1000257Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:3263", "ref_desc": "RHSA-2017:3263 - Security Advisory - Red Hat Customer Portal", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039644", "ref_desc": "cURL Buffer Overread in Processing IMAP FETCH Response Data Lets Remote Users Deny Service or Obtain Potentially Sensitive Information - SecurityTrackerThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201712-04", "ref_desc": "cURL: Multiple vulnerabilities (GLSA 201712-04) \u2014 Gentoo securityCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/CclBcHGsdYCWus1gkykV7K7wOLo.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101519", "ref_desc": "cURL/libcURL CVE-2017-1000257 Buffer Overflow VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3558", "ref_desc": "RHSA-2018:3558 - Security Advisory - Red Hat Customer PortalCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/mgUQtPdB9O4CF8H7o6t0UsX6ajo.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-4007", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-4007-1 curlThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2486", "ref_desc": "RHSA-2018:2486 - Security Advisory - Red Hat Customer PortalCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Z3ydokE4jjDFS3B7j6IpX8DziAY.html"}]}
