{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-15014", "Description": "OpenText Documentum Content Server (formerly EMC Documentum Content Server) through 7.3 contains the following design gap, which allows authenticated users to download arbitrary content files regardless of the attacker's repository permissions: When an authenticated user uploads content to the repository, he performs the following steps: (1) calls the START_PUSH RPC-command; (2) uploads the file to the content server; (3) calls the END_PUSH_V2 RPC-command (here, Content Server returns a DATA_TICKET integer, intended to identify the location of the uploaded file on the Content Server filesystem); (4) creates a dmr_content object in the repository, which has a value of data_ticket equal to the value of DATA_TICKET returned at the end of END_PUSH_V2 call. As the result of this design, any authenticated user may create his own dmr_content object, pointing to already existing content in the Content Server filesystem.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-15014", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOpentext\u00bbDocumentum Content ServerVersions  up to, including, (<=) 7.3cpe:2.3:a:opentext:documentum_content_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.37% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 72 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.60%  0.37%  -0.24 \n 2  2023-03-27  0.54%  0.60%  +0.06 \n 3  2023-03-07  7.31%  0.54%  -6.76 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2017/Oct/19", "ref_desc": "Bugtraq: Multiple vulnerabilities in OpenText Documentum Content ServerMailing List;Third Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/a-_ghUTxsMoJnZ507qSBZvTLhQg.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/43005/", "ref_desc": "OpenText Documentum Content Server - Arbitrary File Download", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101639", "ref_desc": "OpenText Documentum Content Server Multiple Security VulnerabilitiesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/l_oXYD83dzJHXhuht0enRTJ6-LM.html"}]}
