Users with only Overall/Read access to Jenkins were able to access URLs directly that allowed viewing these files. Access to view these files now requires sufficient permissions to configure the provided files, view the configuration of the folder in which the configuration files are defined, or have Job/Configure permissions to a job able to use these files.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-1000104", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nJenkins\u00bbConfig File Provider\u00bbForJenkinsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.16.1cpe:2.3:a:jenkins:config_file_provider:*:*:*:*:*:jenkins:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-04-25  0.06%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 2  2024-03-15  0.06%  0.06%  0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2017-08-07/", "ref_desc": "Jenkins Security Advisory 2017-08-07Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/ulZoO6k2Ada-lkeuJuhMELZCFxM.html"}]}
