{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-9792", "Description": "In Apache Impala (incubating) before 2.10.0, a malicious user with \"ALTER\" permissions on an Impala table can access any other Kudu table data by altering the table properties to make it \"external\" and then changing the underlying table mapping to point to other Kudu tables. This violates and works around the authorization requirement that creating a Kudu external table via Impala requires an \"ALL\" privilege at the server scope. This privilege requirement for \"CREATE\" commands is enforced to precisely avoid this scenario where a malicious user can change the underlying Kudu table mapping. The fix is to enforce the same privilege requirement for \"ALTER\" commands that would make existing non-external Kudu tables external.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-9792", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbImpala\u00bbVersion:2.8.0cpe:2.3:a:apache:impala:2.8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nApache\u00bbImpala\u00bbVersion:2.9.0cpe:2.3:a:apache:impala:2.9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.08%  -0.04 \n 2  2023-11-08  0.16%  0.13%  -0.03 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.16%  -0.73 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/732/Incorrect-Permission-Assignment-for-Critical-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101173", "ref_desc": "Apache IMPALA CVE-2017-9792 Information Disclosure VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/74a163df0cdefcd738c8d18821e69aa69eed2ba5384c0cc255d15c4b@%3Cannounce.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "CVE-2017-9792 Apache Impala (incubating) Information Disclosure - Pony MailMailing List;Mitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IMPALA-5638", "ref_desc": "[IMPALA-5638] Alter table set tblproperties inconsistency for 'external' - ASF JIRAIssue Tracking;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
