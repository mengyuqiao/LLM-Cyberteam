{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-15302", "Description": "In CPUID CPU-Z through 1.81, there are improper access rights to a kernel-mode driver (e.g., cpuz143_x64.sys for version 1.43) that can result in information disclosure or elevation of privileges, because of an arbitrary read of any physical address via ioctl 0x9C402604. Any application running on the system (Windows), including sandboxed users, can issue an ioctl to this driver without any validation. Furthermore, the driver can map any physical page on the system and returns the allocated map page address to the user: that results in an information leak and EoP. NOTE: the vendor indicates that the arbitrary read itself is intentional behavior (for ACPI scan functionality); the security issue is the lack of an ACL.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-15302", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege;Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nCpuid\u00bbCpu-z\u00bbForWindowsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.81cpe:2.3:a:cpuid:cpu-z:*:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/akayn/Bugs/blob/master/CPUID/CVE-2017-15302/README.md", "ref_desc": "Page not found \u00b7 GitHub \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
