{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-1088", "Description": "In FreeBSD before 11.1-STABLE, 11.1-RELEASE-p4, 11.0-RELEASE-p15, 10.4-STABLE, 10.4-RELEASE-p3, and 10.3-RELEASE-p24, the kernel does not properly clear the memory of the kld_file_stat structure before filling the data. Since the structure filled by the kernel is allocated on the kernel stack and copied to userspace, a leak of information from the kernel stack is possible. As a result, some bytes from the kernel stack can be observed in userspace.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-1088", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nFreebsd\u00bbFreebsd\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:freebsd:freebsd:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101857", "ref_desc": "FreeBSD CVE-2017-1088 Local Information Disclosure VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039811", "ref_desc": "FreeBSD kldstat(2) Initialization Error Lets Local Users View Portions of System Memory on the Target System - SecurityTrackerThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-17:10.kldstat.asc", "ref_desc": "Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
