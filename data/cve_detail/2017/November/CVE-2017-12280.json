{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-12280", "Description": "A vulnerability in the Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) Discovery Request parsing functionality of Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation of fields in CAPWAP Discovery Request packets by the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted CAPWAP Discovery Request packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition.
