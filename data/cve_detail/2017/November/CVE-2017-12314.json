{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-12314", "Description": "A vulnerability in the Cisco FindIT Network Discovery Utility could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform a DLL preloading attack, potentially causing a partial impact to the device availability, confidentiality, and integrity, aka Insecure Library Loading. The vulnerability is due to the application loading a malicious copy of a specific, nondefined DLL file instead of the DLL file it was expecting. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by placing an affected DLL within the search path of the host system. An exploit could allow the attacker to load a malicious DLL file into the system, thus partially compromising confidentiality, integrity, and availability on the device.
