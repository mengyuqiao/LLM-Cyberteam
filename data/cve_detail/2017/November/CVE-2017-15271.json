{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-15271", "Description": "A use-after-free issue could be triggered remotely in the SFTP component of PSFTPd 10.0.4 Build 729. This issue could be triggered prior to authentication. The PSFTPd server did not automatically restart, which enabled attackers to perform a very effective DoS attack against this service. By sending a crafted SSH identification / version string to the server, a NULL pointer dereference could be caused, apparently because of a race condition in the window message handling, performing the cleanup for invalid connections. This incorrect cleanup code has a use-after-free.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-15271", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nPsftp\u00bbPsftpd\u00bbVersion:10.0.4cpe:2.3:a:psftp:psftpd:10.0.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.36% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 72 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.49%  0.36%  -0.13 \n 2  2023-10-26  0.69%  0.49%  -0.20 \n 3  2023-08-31  0.97%  0.69%  -0.28 \n 4  2023-07-05  1.15%  0.97%  -0.18 \n 5  2023-05-18  1.35%  1.15%  -0.20 \n 6  2023-05-08  2.61%  1.35%  -1.25 \n 7  2023-04-08  3.13%  2.61%  -0.53 \n 8  2023-03-07  1.02%  3.13%  +2.12 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-416 Use After Free", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/416/Use-After-Free.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/541518/100/0/threaded", "ref_desc": "SecurityFocusCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/eDaPxZtnReLol01vzasQf9MUqvc.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/144972/PSFTPd-Windows-FTP-Server-10.0.4-Build-729-Use-After-Free-Log-Injection.html", "ref_desc": "PSFTPd Windows FTP Server 10.0.4 Build 729 Use-After-Free / Log Injection \u2248 Packet StormThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/LjXfMfHGH3ejS8EJwCNtVv8j9Pc.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/43144/", "ref_desc": "PSFTPd Windows FTP Server 10.0.4 Build 729 - Log Injection / Use-After-FreeThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/PMYbmnTqLhbpeMU2M6AIGpeislQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.x41-dsec.de/lab/advisories/x41-2017-006-psftpd/", "ref_desc": "Advisory X41-2017-006: Multiple Vulnerabilities in PSFTPd Windows FTP server | X41 D-SEC GmbHThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/WuQW6ZDSNNHPW1ARCpY7PLUcoSQ.html"}]}
