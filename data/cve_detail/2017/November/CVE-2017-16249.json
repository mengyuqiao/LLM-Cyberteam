{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-16249", "Description": "The Debut embedded http server contains a remotely exploitable denial of service where a single malformed HTTP POST request can cause the server to hang until eventually replying (~300 seconds) with an HTTP 500 error. While the server is hung, print jobs over the network are blocked and the web interface is inaccessible. An attacker can continuously send this malformed request to keep the device inaccessible to legitimate traffic.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-16249", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nBrother\u00bbDcp-j132w FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.20cpe:2.3:o:brother:dcp-j132w_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Brother\u00bbDcp-j132w\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "12.76% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 95 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  4.17%  12.76%  +8.59 \n 2  2023-05-12  5.81%  4.17%  -1.64 \n 3  2023-04-02  7.15%  5.81%  -1.34 \n 4  2023-03-11  7.07%  7.15%  +0.07 \n 5  2023-03-07  73.45%  7.07%  -66.37 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/43119/", "ref_desc": "Debut Embedded HTTPd 1.20 - Denial of ServiceExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.trustwave.com/Resources/SpiderLabs-Blog/Denial-of-Service-Vulnerability-in-Brother-Printers/?page=1&year=0&month=0&LangType=1033", "ref_desc": "Denial of Service Vulnerability in Brother Printers | Trustwave | SpiderLabs | TrustwaveThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/144908/Debut-Embedded-httpd-1.20-Denial-Of-Service.html", "ref_desc": "Debut Embedded httpd 1.20 Denial Of Service \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.trustwave.com/Resources/Security-Advisories/Advisories/TWSL2017-017/?fid=10211", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
