{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-16524", "Description": "Web Viewer 1.0.0.193 on Samsung SRN-1670D devices suffers from an Unrestricted file upload vulnerability: 'network_ssl_upload.php' allows remote authenticated attackers to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code via a filename with a .php extension, which is then accessed via a direct request to the file in the upload/ directory. To authenticate for this attack, one can obtain web-interface credentials in cleartext by leveraging the existing Local File Read Vulnerability referenced as CVE-2015-8279, which allows remote attackers to read the web-interface credentials via a request for the cslog_export.php?path=/root/php_modules/lighttpd/sbin/userpw URI.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-16524", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nHanwhasecurity\u00bbWeb Viewer\u00bbVersion:1.0.0.193cpe:2.3:a:hanwhasecurity:web_viewer:1.0.0.193:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Samsung\u00bbSrn-1670d\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "28.33% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 97 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  50.83%  28.33%  -22.50 \n 2  2024-08-13  14.83%  50.83%  +36.00 \n 3  2024-08-10  50.83%  14.83%  -36.00 \n 4  2024-01-02  57.97%  50.83%  -7.14 \n 5  2023-07-23  71.16%  57.97%  -13.19 \n 6  2023-03-30  71.40%  71.16%  -0.24 \n 7  2023-03-07  23.12%  71.40%  +48.28 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/realistic-security/CVE-2017-16524", "ref_desc": "GitHub - realistic-security/CVE-2017-16524: Unrestricted file upload vulnerability - Web Viewer 1.0.0.193 on Samsung SRN-1670DExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/43138/", "ref_desc": "Web Viewer 1.0.0.193 (Samsung SRN-1670D) - Unrestricted File UploadExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
