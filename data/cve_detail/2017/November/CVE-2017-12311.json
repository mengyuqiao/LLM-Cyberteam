{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-12311", "Description": "A vulnerability in the H.264 decoder function of Cisco Meeting Server could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a Cisco Meeting Server media process to restart unexpectedly when it receives an illegal H.264 frame. The vulnerability is triggered by an H.264 frame that has an invalid picture parameter set (PPS) value. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed H.264 frame to the targeted device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition because the media process could restart. The media session should be re-established within a few seconds, during which there could be a brief interruption in service.
