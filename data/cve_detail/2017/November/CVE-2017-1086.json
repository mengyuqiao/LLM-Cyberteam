{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-1086", "Description": "In FreeBSD before 11.1-STABLE, 11.1-RELEASE-p4, 11.0-RELEASE-p15, 10.4-STABLE, 10.4-RELEASE-p3, and 10.3-RELEASE-p24, not all information in the struct ptrace_lwpinfo is relevant for the state of any thread, and the kernel does not fill the irrelevant bytes or short strings. Since the structure filled by the kernel is allocated on the kernel stack and copied to userspace, a leak of information of the kernel stack of the thread is possible from the debugger. As a result, some bytes from the kernel stack of the thread using ptrace (PT_LWPINFO) call can be observed in userspace.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-1086", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nFreebsd\u00bbFreebsd\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:freebsd:freebsd:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 21 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.05%  0.05%  0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039809", "ref_desc": "FreeBSD ptrace(2) Initialization Error Lets Local Users View Portions of System Memory on the Target System - SecurityTrackerThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101861", "ref_desc": "FreeBSD CVE-2017-1086 Local Information Disclosure VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-17:08.ptrace.asc", "ref_desc": "Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
