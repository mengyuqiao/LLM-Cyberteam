{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-16763", "Description": "An exploitable vulnerability exists in the YAML parsing functionality in config.py in Confire 0.2.0. Due to the user-specific configuration being loaded from \"~/.confire.yaml\" using the yaml.load function, a YAML parser can execute arbitrary Python commands resulting in command execution. An attacker can insert Python into loaded YAML to trigger this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-16763", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nConfire Project\u00bbConfire\u00bbVersion:0.2.0cpe:2.3:a:confire_project:confire:0.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.99% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 89 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  2.22%  1.99%  -0.23 \n 2  2023-10-21  2.25%  2.22%  -0.03 \n 3  2023-09-20  2.25%  2.25%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-05-13  2.47%  2.25%  -0.22 \n 5  2023-05-08  1.97%  2.47%  +0.51 \n 6  2023-04-03  1.81%  1.97%  +0.16 \n 7  2023-03-07  2.58%  1.81%  -0.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/bbengfort/confire/issues/24", "ref_desc": "load() method in class Configuration is vulnerable \u00b7 Issue #24 \u00b7 bbengfort/confire \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/bbengfort/confire/commit/8cc86a5ec2327e070f1d576d61bbaadf861597ea", "ref_desc": "use safe load instead of load \u00b7 bbengfort/confire@8cc86a5 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://joel-malwarebenchmark.github.io/blog/2017/11/12/cve-2017-16763-configure-loaded-through-confire/", "ref_desc": "cve-2017-16763: configure loaded through Confire - JoelExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
