{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-15054", "Description": "An arbitrary file upload vulnerability, present in TeamPass before 2.1.27.9, allows remote authenticated users to upload arbitrary files leading to Remote Command Execution. To exploit this vulnerability, an authenticated attacker has to tamper with parameters of a request to upload.files.php, in order to select the correct branch and be able to upload any arbitrary file. From there, it can simply access the file to execute code on the server.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-15054", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nTeampass\u00bbTeampassVersions  before (<) 2.1.27.9cpe:2.3:a:teampass:teampass:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.59% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 78 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.27%  0.59%  +0.32 \n 2  2023-10-07  0.19%  0.27%  +0.08 \n 3  2023-05-08  0.23%  0.19%  -0.04 \n 4  2023-03-07  2.66%  0.23%  -2.43 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/434/Unrestricted-Upload-of-File-with-Dangerous-Type.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nilsteampassnet/TeamPass/commit/9811c9d453da4bd1101ff7033250d1fbedf101fc", "ref_desc": "2.1.27 \u00b7 nilsteampassnet/TeamPass@9811c9d \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://blog.amossys.fr/teampass-multiple-cve-01.html", "ref_desc": "AMOSSYS Security BlogExploit;Technical Description;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/kGpZThmDutuXV24sIBp9QtXZisA.html"}]}
