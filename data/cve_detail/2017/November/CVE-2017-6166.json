{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-6166", "Description": "In BIG-IP LTM, AAM, AFM, Analytics, APM, ASM, DNS, Link Controller, PEM, and WebSafe software 12.0.0 to 12.1.1, in some cases the Traffic Management Microkernel (TMM) may crash when processing fragmented packets. This vulnerability affects TMM through a virtual server configured with a FastL4 profile. Traffic processing is disrupted while TMM restarts. If the affected BIG-IP system is configured as part of a device group, it will trigger a failover to the peer device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-6166", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nF5\u00bbBig-ip Link ControllerVersions  from including (>=) 12.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 12.1.1cpe:2.3:a:f5:big-ip_link_controller:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nF5\u00bbBig-ip AnalyticsVersions  from including (>=) 12.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 12.1.1cpe:2.3:a:f5:big-ip_analytics:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nF5\u00bbBig-ip Application Acceleration ManagerVersions  from including (>=) 12.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 12.1.1cpe:2.3:a:f5:big-ip_application_acceleration_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nF5\u00bbLinerateVersions  from including (>=) 2.5.0andup to, including, (<=) 2.6.2cpe:2.3:a:f5:linerate:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nF5\u00bbBig-ip LtmVersions  from including (>=) 12.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 12.1.1cpe:2.3:a:f5:big-ip_ltm:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nF5\u00bbBig-ip AfmVersions  from including (>=) 12.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 12.1.1cpe:2.3:a:f5:big-ip_afm:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nF5\u00bbBig-ip ApmVersions  from including (>=) 12.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 12.1.1cpe:2.3:a:f5:big-ip_apm:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nF5\u00bbBig-ip AsmVersions  from including (>=) 12.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 12.1.1cpe:2.3:a:f5:big-ip_asm:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nF5\u00bbBig-ip PemVersions  from including (>=) 12.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 12.1.1cpe:2.3:a:f5:big-ip_pem:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nF5\u00bbBig-ip DnsVersions  from including (>=) 12.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 12.1.1cpe:2.3:a:f5:big-ip_dns:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nF5\u00bbF5 WebsafeVersions  from including (>=) 12.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 12.1.1cpe:2.3:a:f5:f5_websafe:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 64 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.31%  0.24%  -0.06 \n 2  2023-05-25  0.29%  0.31%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-05-08  0.41%  0.29%  -0.12 \n 4  2023-04-15  0.67%  0.41%  -0.26 \n 5  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.67%  -0.29 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-415 Double Free", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/415/Double-Free.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039949", "ref_desc": "F5 BIG-IP Double Free Memory Error in TMM Lets Remote Users Deny Service - SecurityTrackerThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/102264", "ref_desc": "Multiple F5 BIG-IP Products CVE-2017-6166 Remote Denial of Service VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K65615624", "ref_desc": "Issue Tracking;Mitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
