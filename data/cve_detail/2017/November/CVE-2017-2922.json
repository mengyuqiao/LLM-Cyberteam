{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-2922", "Description": "An exploitable memory corruption vulnerability exists in the Websocket protocol implementation of Cesanta Mongoose 6.8. A specially crafted websocket packet can cause a buffer to be allocated while leaving stale pointers which leads to a use-after-free vulnerability which can be exploited to achieve remote code execution. An attacker needs to send a specially crafted websocket packet over the network to trigger this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-2922", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nCesanta\u00bbMongoose\u00bbVersion:6.8cpe:2.3:a:cesanta:mongoose:6.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.96% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 83 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.96%  0.96%  0.00 \n 2  2024-06-03  0.78%  0.96%  +0.18 \n 3  2024-02-09  0.55%  0.78%  +0.24 \n 4  2023-11-23  0.48%  0.55%  +0.07 \n 5  2023-09-17  0.47%  0.48%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-05-08  0.41%  0.47%  +0.06 \n 7  2023-03-07  3.16%  0.41%  -2.75 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-416 Use After Free", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/416/Use-After-Free.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2017-0429", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2017-0429 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat IntelligenceExploit;Technical Description;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
