{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-15114", "Description": "When libvirtd is configured by OSP director (tripleo-heat-templates) to use the TLS transport it defaults to the same certificate authority as all non-libvirtd services. As no additional authentication is configured this allows these services to connect to libvirtd (which is equivalent to root access). If a vulnerability exists in another service it could, combined with this flaw, be exploited to escalate privileges to gain control over compute nodes.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-15114", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nRedhat\u00bbOpenstack Platform\u00bbVersion:12.0cpe:2.3:a:redhat:openstack_platform:12.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.17%  0.18%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-04-20  0.21%  0.17%  -0.04 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.21%  -0.67 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/tripleo-heat-templates/commit/?id=994922a8ba996fe68d047df0e1486fa805dbea31", "ref_desc": "Disable live migration over TLS \u00b7 994922a8ba - tripleo-heat-templates - OpenDev: Free Software Needs Free ToolsPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101971", "ref_desc": "Red Hat OpenStack Platform CVE-2017-15114 Privilege Escalation VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
