{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-8031", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Cloud Foundry Foundation cf-release (all versions prior to v279) and UAA (30.x versions prior to 30.6, 45.x versions prior to 45.4, 52.x versions prior to 52.1). In some cases, the UAA allows an authenticated user for a particular client to revoke client tokens for other users on the same client. This occurs only if the client is using opaque tokens or JWT tokens validated using the check_token endpoint. A malicious actor could cause denial of service.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-8031", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nCloudfoundry\u00bbCf-releaseVersions  up to, including, (<=) 278cpe:2.3:a:cloudfoundry:cf-release:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCloudfoundry\u00bbUaa-releaseVersions  from including (>=) 30andbefore (<) 30.6cpe:2.3:a:cloudfoundry:uaa-release:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCloudfoundry\u00bbUaa-releaseVersions  from including (>=) 45andbefore (<) 45.4cpe:2.3:a:cloudfoundry:uaa-release:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCloudfoundry\u00bbUaa-release\u00bbVersion:52cpe:2.3:a:cloudfoundry:uaa-release:52:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 28 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-10-07  0.06%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-04-20  0.08%  0.06%  -0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.08%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.cloudfoundry.org/cve-2017-8031/", "ref_desc": "CVE-2017-8031: UAA Denial of Service through client token revocation endpoint | Cloud FoundryIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101967", "ref_desc": "Multiple Cloud Foundry Products CVE-2017-8031 Denial of Service VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
