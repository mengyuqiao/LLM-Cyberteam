{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-1087", "Description": "In FreeBSD 10.x before 10.4-STABLE, 10.4-RELEASE-p3, and 10.3-RELEASE-p24 named paths are globally scoped, meaning a process located in one jail can read and modify the content of POSIX shared memory objects created by a process in another jail or the host system. As a result, a malicious user that has access to a jailed system is able to abuse shared memory by injecting malicious content in the shared memory region. This memory region might be executed by applications trusting the shared memory, like Squid. This issue could lead to a Denial of Service or local privilege escalation.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-1087", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal;Gain privilege;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nFreebsd\u00bbFreebsd\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:freebsd:freebsd:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039810", "ref_desc": "FreeBSD POSIX shm Globally Shared Namespace May Let Local Users Deny Service or Gain Elevated Privileges - SecurityTrackerThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101867", "ref_desc": "FreeBSD CVE-2017-1087 Local Privilege Escalation VulnerabiityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-17:09.shm.asc", "ref_desc": "Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
