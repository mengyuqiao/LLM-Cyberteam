{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-11400", "Description": "An issue has been discovered on the Belden Hirschmann Tofino Xenon Security Appliance before 03.2.00. An incomplete firmware signature allows a local attacker to upgrade the equipment (kernel, file system) with unsigned, attacker-controlled, data. This occurs because the appliance_config file is signed but the .tar.sec file is unsigned.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-11400", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nBelden\u00bbTofino Xenon Security Appliance FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 3.1.0cpe:2.3:o:belden:tofino_xenon_security_appliance_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Belden\u00bbTofino Xenon Security Appliance\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 31 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/347/Improper-Verification-of-Cryptographic-Signature.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.belden.com/hubfs/support/security/bulletins/Belden-Security-Bulletin-BSECV-2017-14-1v1-1.pdf", "ref_desc": "Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/mw9S2p8B0yfY52eRU_KQb1oQB6w.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/airbus-seclab/security-advisories/blob/master/belden/tofino.txt", "ref_desc": "security-advisories/tofino.txt at master \u00b7 airbus-seclab/security-advisories \u00b7 GitHubThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/S5x7lSmNBKNI-_qGM0wqeYNNA14.html"}]}
