{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-12369", "Description": "A \"Cisco WebEx Network Recording Player Out-of-Bounds Vulnerability\" exists in Cisco WebEx Network Recording Player for Advanced Recording Format (ARF) and WebEx Recording Format (WRF) files. A remote attacker could exploit this by providing a user with a malicious ARF or WRF file via email or URL and convincing the user to launch the file. Exploitation of this could cause an affected player to crash and, in some cases, could allow arbitrary code execution on the system of a targeted user.
