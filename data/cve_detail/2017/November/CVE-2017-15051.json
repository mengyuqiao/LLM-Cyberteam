{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-15051", "Description": "Multiple stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in TeamPass before 2.1.27.9 allow authenticated remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the (1) URL value of an item or (2) user log history. To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker must be first authenticated to the application. For the first one, the attacker has to simply inject XSS code within the URL field of a shared item. For the second one however, the attacker must prepare a payload within its profile, and then ask an administrator to modify its profile. From there, whenever the administrator accesses the log, it can be XSS'ed.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-15051", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nTeampass\u00bbTeampassVersions  before (<) 2.1.27.9cpe:2.3:a:teampass:teampass:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.09%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-05-08  0.09%  0.07%  -0.02 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.09%  -0.96 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nilsteampassnet/TeamPass/commit/5f16f6bb132138ee04eb1e0debf2bdc7d7b7a15f", "ref_desc": "2.1.27 \u00b7 nilsteampassnet/TeamPass@5f16f6b \u00b7 GitHubPatchCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/bCD-WQQwLJDwdljQRmSyDQng5iY.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://blog.amossys.fr/teampass-multiple-cve-01.html", "ref_desc": "AMOSSYS Security BlogExploit;Technical Description;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/kGpZThmDutuXV24sIBp9QtXZisA.html"}]}
