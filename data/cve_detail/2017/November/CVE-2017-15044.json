{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-15044", "Description": "The default installation of DocuWare Fulltext Search server through 6.11 allows remote users to connect to and download searchable text from the embedded Solr service, bypassing DocuWare's access control features of the DocuWare user interfaces and API. An attacker can also gain privileges by modifying text. The default installation is unsafe because the server listens on the network interface, not the localhost interface.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-15044", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDocuware\u00bbFulltext ServerVersions  up to, including, (<=) 6.11cpe:2.3:a:docuware:fulltext_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 56 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.22%  0.19%  -0.03 \n 2  2024-01-17  0.23%  0.22%  -0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.23%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.5", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/541548", "ref_desc": "SecurityFocusThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
