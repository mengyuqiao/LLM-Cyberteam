{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-2789", "Description": "When copying filedata into a buffer, JustSystems Ichitaro Office 2016 Trial will calculate two values to determine how much data to copy from the document. If both of these values are larger than the size of the buffer, the application will choose the smaller of the two and trust it to copy data from the file. This value is larger than the buffer size, which leads to a heap-based buffer overflow. This overflow corrupts an offset in the heap used in pointer arithmetic for writing data and can lead to code execution under the context of the application.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-2789", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nJustsystems\u00bbIchitarocpe:2.3:a:justsystems:ichitaro:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.47% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 72 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.58%  0.47%  -1.11 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/96438", "ref_desc": "JustSystems Ichitaro CVE-2017-2789 Heap Buffer Overflow Vulnerability", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.talosintelligence.com/reports/TALOS-2016-0196/", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2016-0196 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat Intelligence", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
