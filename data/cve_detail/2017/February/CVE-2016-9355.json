{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-9355", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Becton, Dickinson and Company (BD) Alaris 8015 Point of Care (PC) unit, Version 9.5 and prior versions, and Version 9.7. An unauthorized user with physical access to an Alaris 8015 PC unit may be able to obtain unencrypted wireless network authentication credentials and other sensitive technical data by disassembling an Alaris 8015 PC unit and accessing the device's flash memory. Older software versions of the Alaris 8015 PC unit, Version 9.5 and prior versions, store wireless network authentication credentials and other sensitive technical data on the affected device's removable flash memory. Being able to remove the flash memory from the affected device reduces the risk of detection, allowing an attacker to extract stored data at the attacker's convenience.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-9355", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nBD\u00bbAlaris 8015 Pc UnitVersions  up to, including, (<=) 9.5cpe:2.3:a:bd:alaris_8015_pc_unit:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nBD\u00bbAlaris 8015 Pc Unit\u00bbVersion:9.7cpe:2.3:a:bd:alaris_8015_pc_unit:9.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-255", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/255/cwe.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/96116", "ref_desc": "Alaris 8015 PC unit CVE-2016-9355 Information Disclosure VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSMA-17-017-02", "ref_desc": "404 - File Not Found | CISAMitigation;Third Party Advisory;US Government ResourceCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/SzCGOkGeEXn74SJ4UZ0ZmaT-ZQY.html"}]}
