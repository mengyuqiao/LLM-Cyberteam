{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-5219", "Description": "An issue was discovered in SageCRM 7.x before 7.3 SP3. The Component Manager functionality, provided by SageCRM, permits additional components to be added to the application to enhance provided functionality. This functionality allows a zip file to be uploaded, containing a valid .ecf component file, which will be extracted to the inf directory outside of the webroot. By creating a zip file containing an empty .ecf file, to pass file-validation checks, any other file provided in zip file will be extracted onto the filesystem. In this case, a web shell with the filename '..\\WWWRoot\\CustomPages\\aspshell.asp' was included within the zip file that, when extracted, traversed back out of the inf directory and into the SageCRM webroot. This permitted remote interaction with the underlying filesystem with the highest privilege level, SYSTEM.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5219", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nSagecrm\u00bbSagecrm\u00bbVersion:7.3UpdateSP1cpe:2.3:a:sagecrm:sagecrm:7.3:sp1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSagecrm\u00bbSagecrm\u00bbVersion:7.3UpdateSP2cpe:2.3:a:sagecrm:sagecrm:7.3:sp2:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSagecrm\u00bbSagecrm\u00bbVersion:7.3cpe:2.3:a:sagecrm:sagecrm:7.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 61 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.23%  0.24%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.23%  -0.66 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://research.aurainfosec.io/disclosures/sagecrm-CVE-2017-5219-CVE-2017-5218/", "ref_desc": "SageCRM - SQL Injection, Arbitrary File Upload \u2022 Aura Information Security Research BlogThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/mz_5er9Yj0tVFX0n3pmoOVjJlpA.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/95968", "ref_desc": "SageCRM SQL Injection and Arbitrary File Upload VulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/zjD_O3Bpsera-VnZEOx87tLyqJo.html"}]}
