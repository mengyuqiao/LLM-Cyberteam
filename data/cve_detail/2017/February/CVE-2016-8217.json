{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-8217", "Description": "EMC RSA BSAFE Crypto-J versions prior to 6.2.2 has a PKCS#12 Timing Attack Vulnerability. A possible timing attack could be carried out by modifying a PKCS#12 file that has an integrity MAC for which the password is not known. An attacker could then feed the modified PKCS#12 file to the toolkit and guess the current MAC one byte at a time. This is possible because Crypto-J uses a non-constant-time method to compare the stored MAC with the calculated MAC. This vulnerability is similar to the issue described in CVE-2015-2601.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-8217", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nDell\u00bbBsafe Crypto-jVersions  before (<) 6.2.2cpe:2.3:a:dell:bsafe_crypto-j:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.16%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.16%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/540066/30/0/threaded", "ref_desc": "SecurityFocusMailing List;Third Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/4jJY2HOSo5THZm7scLLiUiUMtQA.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1037732", "ref_desc": "RSA BSAFE Crypto-J Bugs Let Remote USers Bypass OCSP Time Validation and Conduct Timing Attacks to Determine PKCS MAC Values - SecurityTrackerThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/GkH3enxsSWZatloq4KJ3DfDL2N8.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/95831", "ref_desc": "EMC RSA BSAFE Crypto-J Security Bypass and Information Disclosure VulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Wbdcz8y3quaUt9ePGtX9R-ErKF8.html"}]}
