{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-9682", "Description": "The SonicWall Secure Remote Access server (version 8.1.0.2-14sv) is vulnerable to two Remote Command Injection vulnerabilities in its web administrative interface. These vulnerabilities occur in the diagnostics CGI (/cgi-bin/diagnostics) component responsible for emailing out information about the state of the system. The application doesn't properly escape the information passed in the 'tsrDeleteRestartedFile' or 'currentTSREmailTo' variables before making a call to system(), allowing for remote command injection. Exploitation of this vulnerability yields shell access to the remote machine under the nobody user account.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-9682", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDell\u00bbSonicwall Secure Remote Access Server\u00bbVersion:8.1.0.2-14svcpe:2.3:o:dell:sonicwall_secure_remote_access_server:8.1.0.2-14sv:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "5.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 93 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  5.89%  5.17%  -0.72 \n 2  2024-04-16  4.57%  5.89%  +1.32 \n 3  2023-03-07  8.38%  4.57%  -3.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2016-0003", "ref_desc": "SonicWall Security Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/42342/", "ref_desc": "Sonicwall Secure Remote Access 8.1.0.2-14sv - Command Injection", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/96375", "ref_desc": "Dell SonicWall Secure Remote Access Multiple Command Injection VulnerabilitiesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/lKpmf5ea3-H5WFFGu7mU7oizZN8.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://documents.software.dell.com/sonicwall-sma-100-series/8.1.0.7/release-notes/resolved-issues?ParentProduct=868", "ref_desc": "Release Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Qf788BZff_V-nkWD7F16vJyA6Vk.html"}]}
