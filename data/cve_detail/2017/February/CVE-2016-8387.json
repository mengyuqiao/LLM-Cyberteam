When it attempts to convert a malformed PDF with an object encoded w/ multiple encoding types terminating with an LZW encoded type, an overflow may occur due to a lack of bounds checking by the LZW decoder. This can lead to code execution under the context of the account of the user running it.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-8387", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nIceni\u00bbArgus\u00bbVersion:6.6.04cpe:2.3:a:iceni:argus:6.6.04:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.13%  0.18%  +0.05 \n 2  2023-10-01  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.10%  0.12%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.talosintelligence.com/reports/TALOS-2016-0212/", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2016-0212 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat IntelligenceThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/96468", "ref_desc": "Iceni Argus CVE-2016-8387 Remote Heap Buffer Overflow VulnerabilityBroken Link;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
