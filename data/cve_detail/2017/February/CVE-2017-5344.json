{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-5344", "Description": "An issue was discovered in dotCMS through 3.6.1. The findChildrenByFilter() function which is called by the web accessible path /categoriesServlet performs string interpolation and direct SQL query execution. SQL quote escaping and a keyword blacklist were implemented in a new class, SQLUtil (main/java/com/dotmarketing/common/util/SQLUtil.java), as part of the remediation of CVE-2016-8902; however, these can be overcome in the case of the q and inode parameters to the /categoriesServlet path. Overcoming these controls permits a number of blind boolean SQL injection vectors in either parameter. The /categoriesServlet web path can be accessed remotely and without authentication in a default dotCMS deployment.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5344", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nDotcms\u00bbDotcmsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 3.6.1cpe:2.3:a:dotcms:dotcms:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.34% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 71 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.61%  0.34%  -0.27 \n 2  2023-03-07  5.92%  0.61%  -5.31 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/96259", "ref_desc": "dotCMS CVE-2017-5344 SQL Injection Vulnerability", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41377/", "ref_desc": "dotCMS 3.6.1 - Blind Boolean SQL Injection", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Feb/34", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: CVE-2017-5344 : dotCMS Blind Boolean SQL Injection in dotCMS <= 3.6.1Exploit;Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/xdrr/webapp-exploits/blob/master/vendors/dotcms/2017.01.blind-sqli/dotcms-dump.sh", "ref_desc": "webapp-exploits/dotcms-dump.sh at master \u00b7 xdrr/webapp-exploits \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://dotcms.com/security/SI-39", "ref_desc": "Blind SQL injection | dotCMSVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
