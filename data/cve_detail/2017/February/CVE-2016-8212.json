{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-8212", "Description": "An issue was discovered in EMC RSA BSAFE Crypto-J versions prior to 6.2.2. There is an Improper OCSP Validation Vulnerability. OCSP responses have two time values: thisUpdate and nextUpdate. These specify a validity period; however, both values are optional. Crypto-J treats the lack of a nextUpdate as indicating that the OCSP response is valid indefinitely instead of restricting its validity for a brief period surrounding the thisUpdate time. This vulnerability is similar to the issue described in CVE-2015-4748.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-8212", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDell\u00bbBsafe Crypto-jVersions  before (<) 6.2.2cpe:2.3:a:dell:bsafe_crypto-j:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.19%  0.21%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.19%  -0.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-404 Improper Resource Shutdown or Release", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/404/Improper-Resource-Shutdown-or-Release.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/540066/30/0/threaded", "ref_desc": "SecurityFocusMailing List;Third Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/4jJY2HOSo5THZm7scLLiUiUMtQA.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1037732", "ref_desc": "RSA BSAFE Crypto-J Bugs Let Remote USers Bypass OCSP Time Validation and Conduct Timing Attacks to Determine PKCS MAC Values - SecurityTrackerThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/GkH3enxsSWZatloq4KJ3DfDL2N8.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/95831", "ref_desc": "EMC RSA BSAFE Crypto-J Security Bypass and Information Disclosure VulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Wbdcz8y3quaUt9ePGtX9R-ErKF8.html"}]}
