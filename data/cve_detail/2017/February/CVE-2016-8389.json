{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-8389", "Description": "An exploitable integer-overflow vulnerability exists within Iceni Argus. When it attempts to convert a malformed PDF to XML, it will attempt to convert each character from a font into a polygon and then attempt to rasterize these shapes. As the application attempts to iterate through the rows and initializing the polygon shape in the buffer, it will write outside of the bounds of said buffer. This can lead to code execution under the context of the account running it.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-8389", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nIceni\u00bbArgus\u00bbVersion:6.6.04cpe:2.3:a:iceni:argus:6.6.04:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 55 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.14%  0.18%  +0.03 \n 2  2023-10-02  0.13%  0.14%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.10%  0.13%  -0.97 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/190/Integer-Overflow-or-Wraparound.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.talosintelligence.com/reports/TALOS-2016-0214/", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2016-0214 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat IntelligenceExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/96469", "ref_desc": "Iceni Argus CVE-2016-8389 Remote Integer Overflow VulnerabilityBroken Link;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
