{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-8385", "Description": "An exploitable uninitialized variable vulnerability which leads to a stack-based buffer overflow exists in Iceni Argus. When it attempts to convert a malformed PDF to XML a stack variable will be left uninitialized which will later be used to fetch a length that is used in a copy operation. In most cases this will allow an aggressor to write outside the bounds of a stack buffer which is used to contain colors. This can lead to code execution under the context of the account running the tool.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-8385", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nIceni\u00bbArgus\u00bbVersion:6.6.04cpe:2.3:a:iceni:argus:6.6.04:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.25% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 64 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.23%  0.25%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-10-01  0.21%  0.23%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.10%  0.21%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.talosintelligence.com/reports/TALOS-2016-0210/", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2016-0210 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat IntelligenceExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/96472", "ref_desc": "Iceni Argus Multiple Security VulnerabilitiesBroken Link;Third Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/rV_NCrXEQb_8j1e2A8K_xo3sHhA.html"}]}
