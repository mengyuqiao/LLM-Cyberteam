{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-8386", "Description": "An exploitable heap-based buffer overflow exists in Iceni Argus. When it attempts to convert a PDF containing a malformed font to XML, the tool will attempt to use a size out of the font to search through a linked list of buffers to return. Due to a signedness issue, a buffer smaller than the requested size will be returned. Later when the tool tries to populate this buffer, the overflow will occur which can lead to code execution under the context of the user running the tool.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-8386", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nIceni\u00bbArgus\u00bbVersion:6.6.04cpe:2.3:a:iceni:argus:6.6.04:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.25% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 64 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.23%  0.25%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-10-01  0.21%  0.23%  +0.02 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.10%  0.21%  -0.89 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.talosintelligence.com/reports/TALOS-2016-0211/", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2016-0211 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat IntelligenceExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/96472", "ref_desc": "Iceni Argus Multiple Security VulnerabilitiesBroken Link;Third Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/rV_NCrXEQb_8j1e2A8K_xo3sHhA.html"}]}
