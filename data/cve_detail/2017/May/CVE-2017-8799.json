{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-8799", "Description": "Untrusted input execution via igetwild in all iRODS versions before 4.1.11 and 4.2.1 allows other iRODS users (potentially anonymous) to execute remote shell commands via iRODS virtual pathnames. To exploit this vulnerability, a virtual iRODS pathname that includes a semicolon would be retrieved via igetwild. Because igetwild is a Bash script, the part of the pathname following the semicolon would be executed in the user's shell.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-8799", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nIrods\u00bbIrodsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.1.10cpe:2.3:a:irods:irods:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nIrods\u00bbIrods\u00bbVersion:4.2.0cpe:2.3:a:irods:irods:4.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.38% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 73 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.32%  0.38%  +0.06 \n 2  2024-01-16  0.33%  0.32%  -0.01 \n 3  2023-12-07  0.30%  0.33%  +0.03 \n 4  2023-05-08  0.21%  0.30%  +0.09 \n 5  2023-03-15  0.21%  0.21%  0.00 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.60%  0.21%  -1.39 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/irods/irods/issues/3452", "ref_desc": "igetwild bash cleanup \u00b7 Issue #3452 \u00b7 irods/irods \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
