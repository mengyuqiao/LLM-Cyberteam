{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-6657", "Description": "Cisco Sourcefire Snort 3.0 before build 233 mishandles Ether Type Validation. Since valid ether type and IP protocol numbers do not overlap, Snort++ stores all protocol decoders in a single array. That makes it possible to craft packets that have IP protocol numbers in the ether type field which will confuse the Snort++ decoder. For example, an eth:llc:snap:icmp6 packet will cause a crash because there is no ip6 header with which to calculate the icmp6 checksum. Affected decoders include gre, llc, trans_bridge, ciscometadata, linux_sll, and token_ring. The fix adds a check in the packet manager to validate the ether type before indexing the decoder array. An out of range ether type will raise 116:473.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-6657", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbSnort++\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:cisco:snort\\+\\+:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.10%  -0.02 \n 2  2023-03-26  0.12%  0.12%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.12%  -0.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://blog.snort.org/2017/05/snort-vulnerabilities-found.html", "ref_desc": "Snort Blog: Snort++ Vulnerabilities FoundThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/5CmESm0m65d0mkJsK0L6RuJ9NHk.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1038483", "ref_desc": "Cisco Snort++ Protocol Decoder Bugs Let Remote Users Deny Service - SecurityTrackerCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/wX29o6Mlj9hi2sXa4cHaiMi9QS4.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170515-snort", "ref_desc": "Cisco Snort++ Protocol Decoder Denial of Service VulnerabilitiesVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/zy9bd_hYtNFcFiZmrSpmguW-JAc.html"}]}
