{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-8244", "Description": "In core_info_read and inst_info_read in all Android releases from CAF using the Linux kernel, variable \"dbg_buf\", \"dbg_buf->curr\" and \"dbg_buf->filled_size\" could be modified by different threads at the same time, but they are not protected with mutex or locks. Buffer overflow is possible on race conditions. \"buffer->curr\" itself could also be overwritten, which means that it may point to anywhere of kernel memory (for write).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-8244", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbAndroid\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:google:android:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 19 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.05%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-362 Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/362/Concurrent-Execution-using-Shared-Resource-with-Improper-Syn.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.codeaurora.org/buffer-overflow-msmvidc-debugfs-driver-coreinforead-and-instinforead-cve-2017-8244", "ref_desc": "Page not found - Code AuroraBroken Link", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/pixel/2017-12-01", "ref_desc": "Pixel\u200a/\u200aNexus Security Bulletin\u2014December 2017 \u00a0|\u00a0 Android Open Source ProjectVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/m2Vfac-0emqrIO2L_K7zxydK38c.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/98547", "ref_desc": "Linux Kernel CVE-2017-8244 Multiple Local Buffer Overflow VulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
