{"CVE Code": "CVE-2015-1834", "Description": "A path traversal vulnerability was identified in the Cloud Foundry component Cloud Controller that affects cf-release versions prior to v208 and Pivotal Cloud Foundry Elastic Runtime versions prior to 1.4.2. Path traversal is the 'outbreak' of a given directory structure through relative file paths in the user input. It aims at accessing files and directories that are stored outside the web root folder, for disallowed reading or even executing arbitrary system commands. An attacker could use a certain parameter of the file path for instance to inject '../' sequences in order to navigate through the file system. In this particular case a remote authenticated attacker can exploit the identified vulnerability in order to upload arbitrary files to the server running a Cloud Controller instance - outside the isolated application container.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2015-1834", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nPivotal Software\u00bbCloud Foundry Elastic RuntimeVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.4.1cpe:2.3:a:pivotal_software:cloud_foundry_elastic_runtime:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCloudfoundry\u00bbCf-releaseVersions  up to, including, (<=) 207cpe:2.3:a:cloudfoundry:cf-release:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.10%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.10%  -0.95 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2015-1834", "ref_desc": "CVE-2015-1834 Path Traversal Vulnerability | Security | PivotalVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/98691", "ref_desc": "Multiple Pivotal Products CVE-2015-1834 Directory Traversal VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
