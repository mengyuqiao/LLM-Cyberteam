{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-6025", "Description": "A Stack Buffer Overflow issue was discovered in 3S-Smart Software Solutions GmbH CODESYS Web Server. The following versions of CODESYS Web Server, part of the CODESYS WebVisu web browser visualization software, are affected: CODESYS Web Server Versions 2.3 and prior. A malicious user could overflow the stack buffer by providing overly long strings to functions that handle the XML. Because the function does not verify string size before copying to memory, the attacker may then be able to crash the application or run arbitrary code.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-6025", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nCodesys\u00bbWeb ServerVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.3cpe:2.3:a:codesys:web_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.26% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 65 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.18%  0.26%  +0.08 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.18%  -0.70 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-121 Stack-based Buffer Overflow", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/121/Stack-based-Buffer-Overflow.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/97174", "ref_desc": "CODESYS Web Server Stack Based Buffer Overflow and File Upload VulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/9YonlfB9Y2oHfQm0jQAZhFSUbsg.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-17-087-02", "ref_desc": "3S-Smart Software Solutions GmbH CODESYS Web Server | CISAThird Party Advisory;US Government ResourceCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Vdo1CtndtCXwjbuLPMPuXX8rtHs.html"}]}
