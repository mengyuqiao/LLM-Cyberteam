{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-8850", "Description": "An issue was discovered on OnePlus One, X, 2, 3, and 3T devices. Due to a lenient updater-script in the OnePlus OTA images, and the fact that both ROMs use the same OTA verification keys, attackers can install HydrogenOS over OxygenOS and vice versa, even on locked bootloaders, which allows for exploitation of vulnerabilities patched on one image but not on the other, in addition to expansion of the attack surface. This vulnerability can be exploited by Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) attackers targeting the update process. This is possible because the update transaction does not occur over TLS (CVE-2016-10370). In addition, physical attackers can reboot the phone into recovery, and then use 'adb sideload' to push the OTA (on OnePlus 3/3T 'Secure Start-up' must be off).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-8850", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nOneplus\u00bbOxygenoscpe:2.3:o:oneplus:oxygenos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Oneplus\u00bbOneplus 2\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Oneplus\u00bbOneplus 3\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Oneplus\u00bbOneplus 3t\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Oneplus\u00bbOneplus One\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Oneplus\u00bbOneplus X\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 30 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.06%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-21  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-319 Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/319/Cleartext-Transmission-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://alephsecurity.com/vulns/aleph-2017020", "ref_desc": "[CVE-2017-8850] OnePlus OTA OxygenOS/HydrogenOS Crossover VulnerabilityExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
