{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-8295", "Description": "WordPress through 4.7.4 relies on the Host HTTP header for a password-reset e-mail message, which makes it easier for remote attackers to reset arbitrary passwords by making a crafted wp-login.php?action=lostpassword request and then arranging for this message to bounce or be resent, leading to transmission of the reset key to a mailbox on an attacker-controlled SMTP server. This is related to problematic use of the SERVER_NAME variable in wp-includes/pluggable.php in conjunction with the PHP mail function. Exploitation is not achievable in all cases because it requires at least one of the following: (1) the attacker can prevent the victim from receiving any e-mail messages for an extended period of time (such as 5 days), (2) the victim's e-mail system sends an autoresponse containing the original message, or (3) the victim manually composes a reply containing the original message.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-8295", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nWordpress\u00bbWordpressVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.7.4cpe:2.3:a:wordpress:wordpress:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "9.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 95 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-20  8.69%  9.17%  +0.49 \n 2  2024-12-17  2.80%  8.69%  +5.88 \n 3  2024-11-16  2.62%  2.80%  +0.18 \n 4  2024-06-26  2.83%  2.62%  -0.21 \n 5  2023-09-19  3.55%  2.83%  -0.72 \n 6  2023-03-07  23.48%  3.55%  -19.93 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-640 Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/640/Weak-Password-Recovery-Mechanism-for-Forgotten-Password.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3870", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-3870-1 wordpressCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/cPUpq_ihRwsC3ezfAzEmTQj5gg0.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://exploitbox.io/vuln/WordPress-Exploit-4-7-Unauth-Password-Reset-0day-CVE-2017-8295.html", "ref_desc": "WordPress Core <= 4.7.4 Potential Unauthorized Password Reset (0day)Exploit;Technical Description;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41963/", "ref_desc": "WordPress < 4.7.4 - Unauthorized Password ResetExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1038403", "ref_desc": "WordPress Password Reset Server Name Validation Flaw Lets Remote Users Obtain Password Reset Information for the Target User in Certain Cases - SecurityTracker", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/98295", "ref_desc": "WordPress Password Reset CVE-2017-8295 Security Bypass VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://wpvulndb.com/vulnerabilities/8807", "ref_desc": "WordPress 2.3-4.8.3 - Host Header Injection in Password Reset", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
