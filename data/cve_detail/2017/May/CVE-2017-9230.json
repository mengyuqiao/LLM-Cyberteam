{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-9230", "Description": "The Bitcoin Proof-of-Work algorithm does not consider a certain attack methodology related to 80-byte block headers with a variety of initial 64-byte chunks followed by the same 16-byte chunk, multiple candidate root values ending with the same 4 bytes, and calculations involving sqrt numbers. This violates the security assumptions of (1) the choice of input, outside of the dedicated nonce area, fed into the Proof-of-Work function should not change its difficulty to evaluate and (2) every Proof-of-Work function execution should be independent. NOTE: a number of persons feel that this methodology is a benign mining optimization, not a vulnerability", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-9230", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nBitcoin\u00bbBitcoin\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:bitcoin:bitcoin:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.71% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 80 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.53%  0.71%  +0.17 \n 2  2023-05-04  0.54%  0.53%  -0.01 \n 3  2023-04-03  0.54%  0.54%  0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  2.84%  0.54%  -2.30 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-338 Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/338/Use-of-Cryptographically-Weak-Pseudo-Random-Number-Generator.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-May/014351.html", "ref_desc": "[bitcoin-dev] Treating \u2018ASICBOOST\u2019 as a Security VulnerabilityMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.mit.edu/~jlrubin//public/pdfs/Asicboost.pdf", "ref_desc": "Technical Description", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/98657", "ref_desc": "Bitcoin Proof-of-Work Algorithm CVE-2017-9230 Security WeaknessThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-May/014352.html", "ref_desc": "[bitcoin-dev] Treating \u2018ASICBOOST\u2019 as a Security VulnerabilityMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-April/013996.html", "ref_desc": "[bitcoin-dev] BIP proposal: Inhibiting a covert attack on the Bitcoin POW functionMailing List;Technical Description;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1604/1604.00575.pdf", "ref_desc": "Technical Description", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-May/014349.html", "ref_desc": "[bitcoin-dev] Treating \u2018ASICBOOST\u2019 as a Security VulnerabilityMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
