{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-7229", "Description": "PGP/MIME encrypted messages injected into a Vaultive O365 (before 4.5.21) frontend via IMAP or SMTP have their Content-Type changed from 'Content-Type: multipart/encrypted; protocol=\"application/pgp-encrypted\"; boundary=\"abc123abc123\"' to 'Content-Type: text/plain' - this results in the encrypted message being structured in such a way that most PGP/MIME-capable mail user agents are unable to decrypt it cleanly. The outcome is that encrypted mail passing through this device does not work (Denial of Service), and a common real-world consequence is a request to resend the mail in the clear (Information Disclosure).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-7229", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service;Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nVaultive\u00bbOffice 365 Security\u00bbVersion:4.5.19cpe:2.3:a:vaultive:office_365_security:4.5.19:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.23% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 61 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-01-14  0.21%  0.23%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.21%  -0.68 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-326 Inadequate Encryption Strength", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/326/Inadequate-Encryption-Strength.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://gist.github.com/dkg/a1998c861bf2430e0d01d586905b11cb", "ref_desc": "A description of 2017-7229: Vaultive O365 Content-Type Mangling \u00b7 GitHub", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
