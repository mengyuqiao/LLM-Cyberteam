{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-9228", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Oniguruma 6.2.0, as used in Oniguruma-mod in Ruby through 2.4.1 and mbstring in PHP through 7.1.5. A heap out-of-bounds write occurs in bitset_set_range() during regular expression compilation due to an uninitialized variable from an incorrect state transition. An incorrect state transition in parse_char_class() could create an execution path that leaves a critical local variable uninitialized until it's used as an index, resulting in an out-of-bounds write memory corruption.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-9228", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nPHP\u00bbPHPVersions  from including (>=) 5.6.0andbefore (<) 5.6.31cpe:2.3:a:php:php:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPHP\u00bbPHPVersions  from including (>=) 7.1.0andbefore (<) 7.1.7cpe:2.3:a:php:php:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPHP\u00bbPHPVersions  from including (>=) 7.0.0andbefore (<) 7.0.21cpe:2.3:a:php:php:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOniguruma Project\u00bbOniguruma\u00bbVersion:6.2.0cpe:2.3:a:oniguruma_project:oniguruma:6.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.90% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 82 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.81%  0.90%  +0.09 \n 2  2023-05-08  0.59%  0.81%  +0.22 \n 3  2023-05-04  0.60%  0.59%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-04-03  0.60%  0.60%  0.00 \n 5  2023-03-09  0.85%  0.60%  -0.25 \n 6  2023-03-07  2.58%  0.85%  -1.73 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:1296", "ref_desc": "RHSA-2018:1296 - Security Advisory - Red Hat Customer PortalThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/hh0SFolrNrw_zyLhr2ezMPv5duw.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kkos/oniguruma/issues/60", "ref_desc": "Heap corruption in next_state_val() due to uninitialized local variable \u00b7 Issue #60 \u00b7 kkos/oniguruma \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kkos/oniguruma/commit/3b63d12038c8d8fc278e81c942fa9bec7c704c8b", "ref_desc": "fix #60 : invalid state(CCS_VALUE) in parse_char_class() \u00b7 kkos/oniguruma@3b63d12 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
