{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-5948", "Description": "An issue was discovered on OnePlus One, X, 2, 3, and 3T devices. OxygenOS and HydrogenOS are vulnerable to downgrade attacks. This is due to a lenient 'updater-script' in OTAs that does not check that the current version is lower than or equal to the given image's. Downgrades can occur even on locked bootloaders and without triggering a factory reset, allowing for exploitation of now-patched vulnerabilities with access to user data. This vulnerability can be exploited by a Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) attacker targeting the update process. This is possible because the update transaction does not occur over TLS (CVE-2016-10370). In addition, a physical attacker can reboot the phone into recovery, and then use 'adb sideload' to push the OTA (on OnePlus 3/3T 'Secure Start-up' must be off).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5948", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nOneplus\u00bbOxygenoscpe:2.3:o:oneplus:oxygenos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Oneplus\u00bbOneplus 2\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Oneplus\u00bbOneplus 3\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Oneplus\u00bbOneplus 3t\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Oneplus\u00bbOneplus One\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Oneplus\u00bbOneplus X\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.10%  +0.03 \n 2  2023-03-21  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://alephsecurity.com/vulns/aleph-2017008", "ref_desc": "[CVE-2017-5948] OnePlus OTA Downgrade VulnerabilityExploit;Technical Description;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
