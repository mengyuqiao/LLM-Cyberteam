{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-8769", "Description": "Facebook WhatsApp Messenger before 2.16.323 for Android uses the SD card for cleartext storage of files (Audio, Documents, Images, Video, and Voice Notes) associated with a chat, even after that chat is deleted. There may be users who expect file deletion to occur upon chat deletion, or who expect encryption (consistent with the application's use of an encrypted database to store chat text). NOTE: the vendor reportedly indicates that they do not \"consider these to be security issues\" because a user may legitimately want to preserve any file for use \"in other apps like the Google Photos gallery\" regardless of whether its associated chat is deleted", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-8769", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nWhatsapp\u00bbWhatsapp\u00bbForAndroidVersions  before (<) 2.16.323cpe:2.3:a:whatsapp:whatsapp:*:*:*:*:*:android:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.10%  +0.04 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-311 Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/311/Missing-Encryption-of-Sensitive-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2017/05/17/advisory-whatsapp-for-android-privacy-issues-with-handling-of-media-files-cve-2017-8769/", "ref_desc": "Advisory: WhatsApp for Android Privacy Issues with Handling of Media Files [CVE-2017-8769] | Nightwatch CybersecurityExploit;Mitigation;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/100906", "ref_desc": "WhatsApp CVE-2017-8769 Local Information Disclosure VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
