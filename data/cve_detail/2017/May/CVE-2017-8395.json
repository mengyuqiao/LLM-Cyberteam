{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-8395", "Description": "The Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.28, is vulnerable to an invalid write of size 8 because of missing a malloc() return-value check to see if memory had actually been allocated in the _bfd_generic_get_section_contents function. This vulnerability causes programs that conduct an analysis of binary programs using the libbfd library, such as objcopy, to crash.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-8395", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGNU\u00bbBinutils\u00bbVersion:2.28cpe:2.3:a:gnu:binutils:2.28:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.10%  0.00 \n 2  2023-03-11  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/476/NULL-Pointer-Dereference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201709-02", "ref_desc": "Binutils: Multiple vulnerabilities (GLSA 201709-02) \u2014 Gentoo securityCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/NBQwLpXMN1vCH4W6LDzGgvE2-lI.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=21431", "ref_desc": "21431 \u2013 objcopy segfault - null pointer dereferencingIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
