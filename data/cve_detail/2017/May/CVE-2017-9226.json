{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-9226", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Oniguruma 6.2.0, as used in Oniguruma-mod in Ruby through 2.4.1 and mbstring in PHP through 7.1.5. A heap out-of-bounds write or read occurs in next_state_val() during regular expression compilation. Octal numbers larger than 0xff are not handled correctly in fetch_token() and fetch_token_in_cc(). A malformed regular expression containing an octal number in the form of '\\700' would produce an invalid code point value larger than 0xff in next_state_val(), resulting in an out-of-bounds write memory corruption.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-9226", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nPHP\u00bbPHPVersions  from including (>=) 7.1.0andbefore (<) 7.1.7cpe:2.3:a:php:php:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPHP\u00bbPHPVersions  before (<) 5.6.31cpe:2.3:a:php:php:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPHP\u00bbPHPVersions  from including (>=) 7.0.0andbefore (<) 7.0.21cpe:2.3:a:php:php:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOniguruma Project\u00bbOniguruma\u00bbVersion:6.2.0cpe:2.3:a:oniguruma_project:oniguruma:6.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.32% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 70 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.52%  0.32%  -0.20 \n 2  2023-05-08  0.34%  0.52%  +0.18 \n 3  2023-03-09  0.48%  0.34%  -0.14 \n 4  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.48%  -0.54 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/787/Out-of-bounds-Write.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/kkos/oniguruma/issues/55", "ref_desc": "Heap corruption in next_state_val() in 15 encodings \u00b7 Issue #55 \u00b7 kkos/oniguruma \u00b7 GitHubExploit;Issue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:1296", "ref_desc": "RHSA-2018:1296 - Security Advisory - Red Hat Customer PortalThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/hh0SFolrNrw_zyLhr2ezMPv5duw.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101244", "ref_desc": "Oniguruma Multiple Memory Corruption VulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/mfuUZTBCoMZkm2oNnA0MY1o2Sho.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kkos/oniguruma/commit/f015fbdd95f76438cd86366467bb2b39870dd7c6", "ref_desc": "fix #55 : Byte value expressed in octal must be smaller than 256 \u00b7 kkos/oniguruma@f015fbd \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/kkos/oniguruma/commit/b4bf968ad52afe14e60a2dc8a95d3555c543353a", "ref_desc": "fix #55 : check too big code point value for single byte value in nex\u2026 \u00b7 kkos/oniguruma@b4bf968 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
