{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-9132", "Description": "A hard-coded credentials issue was discovered on Mimosa Client Radios before 2.2.3, Mimosa Backhaul Radios before 2.2.3, and Mimosa Access Points before 2.2.3. These devices run Mosquitto, a lightweight message broker, to send information between devices. By using the vendor's hard-coded credentials to connect to the broker on any device (whether it be an AP, Client, or Backhaul model), an attacker can view all the messages being sent between the devices. If an attacker connects to an AP, the AP will leak information about any clients connected to it, including the serial numbers, which can be used to remotely factory reset the clients via a page in their web interface.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-9132", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMimosa\u00bbClient RadiosVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.2.1cpe:2.3:o:mimosa:client_radios:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMimosa\u00bbBackhaul RadiosVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.2.1cpe:2.3:o:mimosa:backhaul_radios:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.17%  0.17%  0.00 \n 2  2024-03-11  0.17%  0.17%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-02-01  0.17%  0.17%  0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.17%  -0.72 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/798/Use-of-Hard-coded-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://blog.iancaling.com/post/160596244178", "ref_desc": "404 \u2014 Page not foundThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Hi9WapF46X19Azo8xeXqzbSn9Xo.html"}]}
