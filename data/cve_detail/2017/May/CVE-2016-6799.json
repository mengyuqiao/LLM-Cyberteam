{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-6799", "Description": "Product: Apache Cordova Android 5.2.2 and earlier. The application calls methods of the Log class. Messages passed to these methods (Log.v(), Log.d(), Log.i(), Log.w(), and Log.e()) are stored in a series of circular buffers on the device. By default, a maximum of four 16 KB rotated logs are kept in addition to the current log. The logged data can be read using Logcat on the device. When using platforms prior to Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean), the log data is not sandboxed per application; any application installed on the device has the capability to read data logged by other applications.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-6799", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbCordova\u00bbForAndroidVersions  up to, including, (<=) 5.2.2cpe:2.3:a:apache:cordova:*:*:*:*:*:android:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-532 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/532/Insertion-of-Sensitive-Information-into-Log-File.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/98365", "ref_desc": "Apache Cordova For Android CVE-2016-6799 Information Disclosure VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/1f3e7b0319d64b455f73616f572acee36fbca31f87f5b2e509c45b69@%3Cdev.cordova.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "Pony Mail!Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
