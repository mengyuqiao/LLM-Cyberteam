{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-8396", "Description": "The Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.28, is vulnerable to an invalid read of size 1 because the existing reloc offset range tests didn't catch small negative offsets less than the size of the reloc field. This vulnerability causes programs that conduct an analysis of binary programs using the libbfd library, such as objdump, to crash.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-8396", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nGNU\u00bbBinutils\u00bbVersion:2.28cpe:2.3:a:gnu:binutils:2.28:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.10%  0.00 \n 2  2023-03-11  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201709-02", "ref_desc": "Binutils: Multiple vulnerabilities (GLSA 201709-02) \u2014 Gentoo securityCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/NBQwLpXMN1vCH4W6LDzGgvE2-lI.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=21432", "ref_desc": "21432 \u2013 heap buffer overflow in objdumpIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
