{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-9136", "Description": "An issue was discovered on Mimosa Client Radios before 2.2.3. In the device's web interface, there is a page that allows an attacker to use an unsanitized GET parameter to download files from the device as the root user. The attacker can download any file from the device's filesystem. This can be used to view unsalted, MD5-hashed administrator passwords, which can then be cracked, giving the attacker full admin access to the device's web interface. This vulnerability can also be used to view the plaintext pre-shared key (PSK) for encrypted wireless connections, or to view the device's serial number (which allows an attacker to factory reset the device).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-9136", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMimosa\u00bbClient RadiosVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.2.1cpe:2.3:o:mimosa:client_radios:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMimosa\u00bbBackhaul RadiosVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.2.1cpe:2.3:o:mimosa:backhaul_radios:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.17%  0.14%  -0.03 \n 2  2024-03-11  0.17%  0.17%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-02-01  0.17%  0.17%  0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.17%  -0.72 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-327 Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/327/Use-of-a-Broken-or-Risky-Cryptographic-Algorithm.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-522 Insufficiently Protected Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/522/Insufficiently-Protected-Credentials.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/732/Incorrect-Permission-Assignment-for-Critical-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://blog.iancaling.com/post/160596244178", "ref_desc": "404 \u2014 Page not foundThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Hi9WapF46X19Azo8xeXqzbSn9Xo.html"}]}
