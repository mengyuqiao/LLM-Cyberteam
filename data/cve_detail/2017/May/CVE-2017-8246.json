{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-8246", "Description": "In function msm_pcm_playback_close() in all Android releases from CAF using the Linux kernel, prtd is assigned substream->runtime->private_data. Later, prtd is freed. However, prtd is not sanitized and set to NULL, resulting in a dangling pointer. There are other functions that access the same memory (substream->runtime->private_data) with a NULL check, such as msm_pcm_volume_ctl_put(), which means this freed memory could be used.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-8246", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbAndroid\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:google:android:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-416 Use After Free", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/416/Use-After-Free.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2017-07-01", "ref_desc": "Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Qsm4YBwpGjEv_wr69rH2tvrWTSM.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.codeaurora.org/use-after-free-alsa-pcm-playback-kernel-module-cve-2017-8246", "ref_desc": "Page not found - Code AuroraBroken Link", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
