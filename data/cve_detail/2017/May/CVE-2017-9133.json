In the device's web interface, after logging in, there is a page that allows you to ping other hosts from the device and view the results. The user is allowed to specify which host to ping, but this variable is not sanitized server-side, which allows an attacker to pass a specially crafted string to execute shell commands as the root user.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-9133", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMimosa\u00bbClient RadiosVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.2.1cpe:2.3:o:mimosa:client_radios:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMimosa\u00bbBackhaul RadiosVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.2.1cpe:2.3:o:mimosa:backhaul_radios:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.11%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/74/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-in-Output-Used-b.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://blog.iancaling.com/post/160596244178", "ref_desc": "404 \u2014 Page not foundThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Hi9WapF46X19Azo8xeXqzbSn9Xo.html"}]}
