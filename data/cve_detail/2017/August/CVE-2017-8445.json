{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-8445", "Description": "An error was found in the X-Pack Security TLS trust manager for versions 5.0.0 to 5.5.1. If reloading the trust material fails the trust manager will be replaced with an instance that trusts all certificates. This could allow any node using any certificate to join a cluster. The proper behavior in this instance is for the TLS trust manager to deny all certificates.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-8445", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nElastic\u00bbX-packVersions  from including (>=) 5.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 5.5.1cpe:2.3:a:elastic:x-pack:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.elastic.co/community/security", "ref_desc": "Elastic Stack Security Disclosures \u00b7 Report Issues | ElasticVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/RMrGSY_VFXOZ71yMK5E8GE1-n1E.html"}]}
