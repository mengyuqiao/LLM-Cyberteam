{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-9799", "Description": "It was found that under some situations and configurations of Apache Storm 1.x before 1.0.4 and 1.1.x before 1.1.1, it is theoretically possible for the owner of a topology to trick the supervisor to launch a worker as a different, non-root, user. In the worst case this could lead to secure credentials of the other user being compromised.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-9799", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbStorm\u00bbVersion:1.1cpe:2.3:a:apache:storm:1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nApache\u00bbStorm\u00bbVersion:1.0cpe:2.3:a:apache:storm:1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nApache\u00bbStorm\u00bbVersion:1.0.1cpe:2.3:a:apache:storm:1.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nApache\u00bbStorm\u00bbVersion:1.0.2cpe:2.3:a:apache:storm:1.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nApache\u00bbStorm\u00bbVersion:1.0.3cpe:2.3:a:apache:storm:1.0.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.29% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 68 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.39%  0.29%  -0.10 \n 2  2023-11-08  0.28%  0.39%  +0.11 \n 3  2023-03-29  0.41%  0.28%  -0.14 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.41%  -0.54 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/b9125bf507ed6f2ca6e85ba1a4b44e232aa70eeddfba2a9d8a954127@%3Cdev.storm.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "[CVE-2017-9799] Apache Storm Possible Code Execution As A Different User - Pony MailMailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/100235", "ref_desc": "Apache Storm CVE-2017-9799 Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039116", "ref_desc": "Apache Storm Unspecified Flaw Lets Remote Authenticated Users View Other User Credentials in Certain Cases. - SecurityTrackerThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
