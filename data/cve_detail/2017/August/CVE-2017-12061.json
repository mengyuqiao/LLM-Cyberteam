{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-12061", "Description": "An XSS issue was discovered in admin/install.php in MantisBT before 1.3.12 and 2.x before 2.5.2. Some variables under user control in the MantisBT installation script are not properly sanitized before being output, allowing remote attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript code, as demonstrated by the $f_database, $f_db_username, and $f_admin_username variables. This is mitigated by the fact that the admin/ folder should be deleted after installation, and also prevented by CSP.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-12061", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nMantisbt\u00bbMantisbtVersions  from including (>=) 1.3.0andbefore (<) 1.3.12cpe:2.3:a:mantisbt:mantisbt:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nMantisbt\u00bbMantisbtVersions  from including (>=) 2.0.0andbefore (<) 2.5.2cpe:2.3:a:mantisbt:mantisbt:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.28% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 68 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.23%  0.28%  +0.05 \n 2  2023-05-08  0.28%  0.23%  -0.05 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.32%  0.28%  -1.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://mantisbt.org/bugs/view.php?id=23146", "ref_desc": "0023146: CVE-2017-12061: XSS in /admin/install.php script - MantisBTIssue Tracking;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/08/01/2", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Re: Advisory: XSS issues in MantisBT (CVE-2017-12061, CVE-2017-12062)Mailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/8K46M1dStyEzhl9Od7BaL6zsfJk.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/commit/c73ae3d3d4dd4681489a9e697e8ade785e27cba5", "ref_desc": "Fix XSS in install.php (CVE-2017-12061) \u00b7 mantisbt/mantisbt@c73ae3d \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039030", "ref_desc": "MantisBT Input Validation Flaws in '/admin/install.php' and 'manage_user_page.php' Let Remote Users Conduct Cross-Site Scripting Attacks - SecurityTrackerThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/OcKPFrF8BfOZNZyN0KOSggtuK3s.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/08/01/1", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Advisory: XSS issues in MantisBT (CVE-2017-12061, CVE-2017-12062)Mailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Res8grw9BJq-wzlfLoBtEm2_KaI.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/commit/17f9b94f031ba93ae2a727bca0e68458ecd08fb0", "ref_desc": "Fix XSS in install.php (CVE-2017-12061) \u00b7 mantisbt/mantisbt@17f9b94 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
