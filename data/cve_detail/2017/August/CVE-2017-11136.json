{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-11136", "Description": "An issue was discovered in heinekingmedia StashCat through 1.7.5 for Android, through 0.0.80w for Web, and through 0.0.86 for Desktop. It uses RSA to exchange a secret for symmetric encryption of messages. However, the private RSA key is not only stored on the client but transmitted to the backend, too. Moreover, the key to decrypt the private key is composed of the first 32 bytes of the SHA-512 hash of the user password. But this hash is stored on the backend, too. Therefore, everyone with access to the backend database can read the transmitted secret for symmetric encryption, hence can read the communication.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-11136", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nStashcat\u00bbHeinekingmedia\u00bb     DesktopEditionVersions  up to, including, (<=) 0.0.86wcpe:2.3:a:stashcat:heinekingmedia:*:*:*:*:desktop:*:*:*Matching versions\nStashcat\u00bbHeinekingmedia\u00bb     WEBEditionVersions  up to, including, (<=) 0.0.80wcpe:2.3:a:stashcat:heinekingmedia:*:*:*:*:web:*:*:*Matching versions\nStashcat\u00bbHeinekingmedia\u00bbForAndroidVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.7.5cpe:2.3:a:stashcat:heinekingmedia:*:*:*:*:*:android:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 30 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.06%  0.06%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Jul/90", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: CIPH-2017-1: Advisory for StashCatMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/5CMGnon4EnO_7S0Dp6c9c0BF63c.html"}]}
