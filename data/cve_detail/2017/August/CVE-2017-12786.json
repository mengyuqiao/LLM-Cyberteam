{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-12786", "Description": "Network interfaces of the cliengine and noviengine services, included in the NoviWare software distribution through NW400.2.6 and deployed on NoviSwitch devices, can be inadvertently exposed if an operator attempts to modify ACLs, because of a bug when ACL modifications are applied. This could be leveraged by remote, unauthenticated attackers to gain resultant privileged (root) code execution on the switch, because there is a stack-based buffer overflow during unserialization of packet data.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-12786", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nNoviflow\u00bbNoviwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 400.2.6cpe:2.3:a:noviflow:noviware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.68% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 80 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.19%  0.68%  -0.51 \n 2  2024-05-04  1.36%  1.19%  -0.18 \n 3  2024-03-25  1.28%  1.36%  +0.08 \n 4  2023-11-26  1.39%  1.28%  -0.11 \n 5  2023-09-07  1.65%  1.39%  -0.26 \n 6  2023-08-02  1.49%  1.65%  +0.16 \n 7  2023-07-02  1.42%  1.49%  +0.08 \n 8  2023-03-07  1.70%  1.42%  -0.29 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/42518/", "ref_desc": "NoviFlow NoviWare < NW400.2.6 - Multiple VulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/jyh3BTrSslBiUYhz100qBJDTuvM.html"}]}
