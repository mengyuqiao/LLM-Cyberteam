{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-12581", "Description": "GitHub Electron before 1.6.8 allows remote command execution because of a nodeIntegration bypass vulnerability. This also affects all applications that bundle Electron code equivalent to 1.6.8 or earlier. Bypassing the Same Origin Policy (SOP) is a precondition; however, recent Electron versions do not have strict SOP enforcement. Combining an SOP bypass with a privileged URL internally used by Electron, it was possible to execute native Node.js primitives in order to run OS commands on the user's host. Specifically, a chrome-devtools://devtools/bundled/inspector.html window could be used to eval a Node.js child_process.execFile API call.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-12581", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nElectron\u00bbElectronVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.6.7cpe:2.3:a:electron:electron:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.56% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 78 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.54%  0.56%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-03-09  0.44%  0.54%  +0.10 \n 3  2023-11-09  0.43%  0.44%  +0.02 \n 4  2023-03-07  2.17%  0.43%  -1.74 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://doyensec.com/resources/us-17-Carettoni-Electronegativity-A-Study-Of-Electron-Security.pdf", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Technical Description;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://blog.doyensec.com/2017/08/03/electron-framework-security.html", "ref_desc": "Modern Alchemy: Turning XSS into RCE \u00b7 Doyensec's BlogExploit;Technical Description;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
