{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-6329", "Description": "Symantec VIP Access for Desktop prior to 2.2.4 can be susceptible to a DLL Pre-Loading vulnerability. These types of issues occur when an application looks to call a DLL for execution and an attacker provides a malicious DLL to use instead. Depending on how the application is configured, the application will generally follow a specific search path to locate the DLL. The exploitation of the vulnerability manifests as a simple file write (or potentially an over-write) which results in a foreign executable running under the context of the application.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-6329", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSymantec\u00bbVip Access For DesktopVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.2.3cpe:2.3:a:symantec:vip_access_for_desktop:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.10%  0.04%  -1.06 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-427 Uncontrolled Search Path Element", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/427/Uncontrolled-Search-Path-Element.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/100200", "ref_desc": "Symantec VIP Access Desktop DLL Loading CVE-2017-6329 Local Code Execution VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.symantec.com/security_response/securityupdates/detail.jsp?fid=security_advisory&pvid=security_advisory&year=&suid=20170821_00", "ref_desc": "Symantec VIP Access DLL Pre-LoadingVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
