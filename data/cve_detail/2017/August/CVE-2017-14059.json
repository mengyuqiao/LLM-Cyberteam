{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-14059", "Description": "In FFmpeg 3.3.3, a DoS in cine_read_header() due to lack of an EOF check might cause huge CPU and memory consumption. When a crafted CINE file, which claims a large \"duration\" field in the header but does not contain sufficient backing data, is provided, the image-offset parsing loop would consume huge CPU and memory resources, since there is no EOF check inside the loop.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-14059", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nFfmpeg\u00bbFfmpeg\u00bbVersion:3.3.3cpe:2.3:a:ffmpeg:ffmpeg:3.3.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.22% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.22%  0.22%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-05-08  0.26%  0.22%  -0.04 \n 3  2023-04-20  0.31%  0.26%  -0.05 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.31%  -0.65 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-834 Excessive Iteration", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/834/Excessive-Iteration.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3996", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-3996-1 ffmpegCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/GpKmtSlYUxgynyzvGhtJuf8iCOo.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/commit/7e80b63ecd259d69d383623e75b318bf2bd491f6", "ref_desc": "avformat/cinedec: Fix DoS due to lack of eof check \u00b7 FFmpeg/FFmpeg@7e80b63 \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/100631", "ref_desc": "FFmpeg 'libavformat/cinedec.c' Denial of Service Vulnerability", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
