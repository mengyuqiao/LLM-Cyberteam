{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-12448", "Description": "The bfd_cache_close function in bfd/cache.c in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.29 and earlier, allows remote attackers to cause a heap use after free and possibly achieve code execution via a crafted nested archive file. This issue occurs because incorrect functions are called during an attempt to release memory. The issue can be addressed by better input validation in the bfd_generic_archive_p function in bfd/archive.c.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-12448", "Vulnerability Categories": "Memory Corruption", "Affected Products": "\nGNU\u00bbBinutilsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.29cpe:2.3:a:gnu:binutils:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 84 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.14%  1.12%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-09-26  0.81%  1.14%  +0.33 \n 3  2024-09-17  0.17%  0.81%  +0.64 \n 4  2024-05-10  0.16%  0.17%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-04-25  0.13%  0.16%  +0.03 \n 6  2024-03-15  0.12%  0.13%  +0.01 \n 7  2024-02-09  0.67%  0.12%  -0.55 \n 8  2023-12-20  0.71%  0.67%  -0.03 \n 9  2023-11-08  0.47%  0.71%  +0.24 \n 10  2023-08-20  0.41%  0.47%  +0.06 \n 11  2023-07-15  0.25%  0.41%  +0.17 \n 12  2023-06-14  0.20%  0.25%  +0.05 \n 13  2023-03-07  1.64%  0.20%  -1.44 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-416 Use After Free", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/416/Use-After-Free.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=21787", "ref_desc": "21787 \u2013 Heap-use-after-free in bfd_cache_closeIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
