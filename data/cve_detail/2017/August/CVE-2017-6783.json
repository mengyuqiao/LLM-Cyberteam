{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-6783", "Description": "A vulnerability in SNMP polling for the Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA), Email Security Appliance (ESA), and Content Security Management Appliance (SMA) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to discover confidential information about the appliances that should be available only to an administrative user. The vulnerability occurs because the appliances do not protect confidential information at rest in response to Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) poll requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by doing a crafted SNMP poll request to the targeted security appliance. An exploit could allow the attacker to discover confidential information that should be restricted, and the attacker could use this information to conduct additional reconnaissance. The attacker must know the configured SNMP community string to exploit this vulnerability. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve26106, CSCve26202, CSCve26224. Known Affected Releases: 10.0.0-230 (Web Security Appliance), 9.7.2-065 (Email Security Appliance), and 10.1.0-037 (Content Security Management Appliance).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-6783", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nCisco\u00bbWeb Security Appliance\u00bbVersion:10.0.0-230cpe:2.3:a:cisco:web_security_appliance:10.0.0-230:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbContent Security Management Appliance\u00bbVersion:10.1.0-037cpe:2.3:a:cisco:content_security_management_appliance:10.1.0-037:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCisco\u00bbEmail Security Appliance\u00bbVersion:9.7.2-065cpe:2.3:a:cisco:email_security_appliance:9.7.2-065:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 56 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.14%  0.18%  +0.04 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.13%  0.14%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/100387", "ref_desc": "Multiple Cisco Products CVE-2017-6783 Information Disclosure VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039186", "ref_desc": "Cisco Content Security Management Appliance SNMP Polling Flaw Lets Remote Authenticated Users Obtain Potentially Sensitive Information - SecurityTrackerThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039187", "ref_desc": "Cisco Email Security Appliance SNMP Polling Flaw Lets Remote Authenticated Users Obtain Potentially Sensitive Information - SecurityTrackerThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039188", "ref_desc": "Cisco Web Security Appliance SNMP Polling Flaw Lets Remote Authenticated Users Obtain Potentially Sensitive Information - SecurityTrackerThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170816-csa", "ref_desc": "Cisco Security Appliances SNMP Polling Information Disclosure VulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
