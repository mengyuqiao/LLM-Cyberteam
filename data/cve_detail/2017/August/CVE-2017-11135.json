{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-11135", "Description": "An issue was discovered in heinekingmedia StashCat through 1.7.5 for Android, through 0.0.80w for Web, and through 0.0.86 for Desktop. The logout mechanism does not check for authorization. Therefore, an attacker only needs to know the device ID. This causes a denial of service. This might be interpreted as a vulnerability in customer-controlled software, in the sense that the StashCat client side has no secure way to signal that it is ending a session and that data should be deleted.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-11135", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nStashcat\u00bbHeinekingmedia\u00bb     DesktopEditionVersions  up to, including, (<=) 0.0.86wcpe:2.3:a:stashcat:heinekingmedia:*:*:*:*:desktop:*:*:*Matching versions\nStashcat\u00bbHeinekingmedia\u00bb     WEBEditionVersions  up to, including, (<=) 0.0.80wcpe:2.3:a:stashcat:heinekingmedia:*:*:*:*:web:*:*:*Matching versions\nStashcat\u00bbHeinekingmedia\u00bbForAndroidVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.7.5cpe:2.3:a:stashcat:heinekingmedia:*:*:*:*:*:android:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.08%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-06-11  0.09%  0.09%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-862 Missing Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/862/Missing-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Jul/90", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: CIPH-2017-1: Advisory for StashCatMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/5CMGnon4EnO_7S0Dp6c9c0BF63c.html"}]}
