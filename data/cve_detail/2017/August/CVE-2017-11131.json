{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-11131", "Description": "An issue was discovered in heinekingmedia StashCat through 1.7.5 for Android, through 0.0.80w for Web, and through 0.0.86 for Desktop. For authentication, the user password is hashed directly with SHA-512 without a salt or another key-derivation mechanism to enable a secure secret for authentication. Moreover, only the first 32 bytes of the hash are used. This allows for easy dictionary and rainbow-table attacks if an attacker has access to the password hash.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-11131", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nStashcat\u00bbHeinekingmedia\u00bb     DesktopEditionVersions  up to, including, (<=) 0.0.86wcpe:2.3:a:stashcat:heinekingmedia:*:*:*:*:desktop:*:*:*Matching versions\nStashcat\u00bbHeinekingmedia\u00bb     WEBEditionVersions  up to, including, (<=) 0.0.80wcpe:2.3:a:stashcat:heinekingmedia:*:*:*:*:web:*:*:*Matching versions\nStashcat\u00bbHeinekingmedia\u00bbForAndroidVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.7.5cpe:2.3:a:stashcat:heinekingmedia:*:*:*:*:*:android:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.17%  0.14%  -0.03 \n 2  2024-05-22  0.17%  0.17%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-04-13  0.17%  0.17%  0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.17%  -0.72 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-916 Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/916/Use-of-Password-Hash-With-Insufficient-Computational-Effort.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Jul/90", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: CIPH-2017-1: Advisory for StashCatMailing List;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/5CMGnon4EnO_7S0Dp6c9c0BF63c.html"}]}
