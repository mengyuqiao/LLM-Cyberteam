{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-5624", "Description": "An issue was discovered in OxygenOS before 4.0.3 for OnePlus 3 and 3T. The attacker can persistently make the (locked) bootloader start the platform with dm-verity disabled, by issuing the 'fastboot oem disable_dm_verity' command. Having dm-verity disabled, the kernel will not verify the system partition (and any other dm-verity protected partition), which may allow for persistent code execution and privilege escalation.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5624", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nOneplus\u00bbOxygenosVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.0.2cpe:2.3:o:oneplus:oxygenos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Oneplus\u00bbOneplus 3\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Oneplus\u00bbOneplus 3t\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "2.54% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 90 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.08%  2.54%  +1.46 \n 2  2023-10-13  1.00%  1.08%  +0.08 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.60%  1.00%  -0.60 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://securityresear.ch/2017/02/08/oneplus3-bootloader-vulns/", "ref_desc": "Owning a Locked OnePlus 3/3T: Bootloader Vulnerabilities - securityresear.chExploit;Technical Description;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/xdhlPFxuKT0S6IIAEQMHXkQ0o2s.html"}]}
