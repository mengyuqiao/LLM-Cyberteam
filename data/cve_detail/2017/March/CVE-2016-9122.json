{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-9122", "Description": "go-jose before 1.0.4 suffers from multiple signatures exploitation. The go-jose library supports messages with multiple signatures. However, when validating a signed message the API did not indicate which signature was valid, which could potentially lead to confusion. For example, users of the library might mistakenly read protected header values from an attached signature that was different from the one originally validated.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-9122", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nGo-jose Project\u00bbGo-joseVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.0.3cpe:2.3:a:go-jose_project:go-jose:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.13%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-284 Improper Access Control", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/284/Improper-Access-Control.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/169629", "ref_desc": "Sign inPermissions Required", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/square/go-jose/commit/2c5656adca9909843c4ff50acf1d2cf8f32da7e6", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #111 from square/cs/better-multi \u00b7 square/go-jose@2c5656a \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/11/03/1", "ref_desc": "oss-security - CVE request: multiple issues in go-jose packageMailing List;Patch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/o9His287TXr_zYuFsFdcEv0Qy0k.html"}]}
