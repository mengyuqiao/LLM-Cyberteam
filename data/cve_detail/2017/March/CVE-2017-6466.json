{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-6466", "Description": "F-Secure Software Updater 2.20, as distributed in several F-Secure products, downloads installation packages over plain http and does not perform file integrity validation after download. Man-in-the-middle attackers can replace the file with their own executable which will be executed under the SYSTEM account. Note that when Software Updater is configured to install updates automatically, it checks if the downloaded file is digitally signed by default, but does not check the author of the signature. When running in manual mode (default), no signature check is performed.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-6466", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nF-secure\u00bbSoftware Updater\u00bbVersion:2.20cpe:2.3:a:f-secure:software_updater:2.20:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 51 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.14%  0.15%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.14%  -0.74 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/96784", "ref_desc": "F-Secure Anti-Virus CVE-2017-6466 Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Mar/28", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: CVE-2017-6466 - Remote Code Execution under SYSTEM via MITM in F-Secure AVMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
