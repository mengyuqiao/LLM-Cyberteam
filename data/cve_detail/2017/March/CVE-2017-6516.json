{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-6516", "Description": "A Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability in MagniComp's Sysinfo before 10-H64 for Linux and UNIX platforms could allow a local attacker to gain elevated privileges. Parts of SysInfo require setuid-to-root access in order to access restricted system files and make restricted kernel calls. This access could be exploited by a local attacker to gain a root shell prompt using the right combination of environment variables and command line arguments.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-6516", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nMagnicomp\u00bbSysinfoVersions  up to, including, (<=) 10-h62cpe:2.3:a:magnicomp:sysinfo:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 36 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.08%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  6.34%  0.08%  -6.26 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.magnicomp.com/support/cve/CVE-2017-6516.shtml", "ref_desc": "Security Vulnerability Notice - CVE-2017-6516Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://labs.mwrinfosecurity.com/advisories/multiple-vulnerabilities-in-magnicomps-sysinfo-root-setuid/", "ref_desc": "Multiple Vulnerabilities in MagniComp's SysInfo root setuid()Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/96934", "ref_desc": "MagniComp Sysinfo CVE-2017-6516 Local Privilege Escalation VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://labs.mwrinfosecurity.com/advisories/magnicomps-sysinfo-root-setuid-local-privilege-escalation-vulnerability/", "ref_desc": "MagniComp's SysInfo root setuid() Local Privilege Escalation VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44150/", "ref_desc": "MagniComp SysInfo - mcsiwrapper Privilege Escalation (Metasploit)", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
