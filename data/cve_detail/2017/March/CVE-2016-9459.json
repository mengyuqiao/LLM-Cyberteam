{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-9459", "Description": "Nextcloud Server before 9.0.52 & ownCloud Server before 9.0.4 are vulnerable to a log pollution vulnerability potentially leading to a local XSS. The download log functionality in the admin screen is delivering the log in JSON format to the end-user. The file was delivered with an attachment disposition forcing the browser to download the document. However, Firefox running on Microsoft Windows would offer the user to open the data in the browser as an HTML document. Thus any injected data in the log would be executed.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-9459", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nOwncloud\u00bbOwncloudVersions  before (<) 9.0.4cpe:2.3:a:owncloud:owncloud:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud ServerVersions  before (<) 9.0.52cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.17%  0.10%  -0.07 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.18%  0.17%  -1.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-209 Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/209/Generation-of-Error-Message-Containing-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/owncloud/core/commit/044ee072a647636b1a17c89265c7233b35371335", "ref_desc": "[stable8.1] Set content type when downloading log file to force downl\u2026 \u00b7 owncloud/core@044ee07 \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/97284", "ref_desc": "ownCloud and Nextcloud CVE-2016-9459 HTML Injection VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/server/commit/94975af6db1551c2d23136c2ea22866a5b416070", "ref_desc": "[stable9] Set content-type to \"application/octet-stream\" \u00b7 nextcloud/server@94975af \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://owncloud.org/security/advisory?id=oc-sa-2016-012", "ref_desc": "Security Advisories \u2013 ownCloudPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://nextcloud.com/security/advisory/?id=nc-sa-2016-002", "ref_desc": "advisory \u2013 NextcloudPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/146278", "ref_desc": "#146278 Log pollution can lead to HTML Injection.Exploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/owncloud/core/commit/b7fa2c5dc945b40bc6ed0a9a0e47c282ebf043e1", "ref_desc": "[stable8.2] Set content type when downloading log file to force downl\u2026 \u00b7 owncloud/core@b7fa2c5 \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/owncloud/core/commit/efa35d621dc7ff975468e636a5d1c153511296dc", "ref_desc": "[stable9] Set content type when downloading log file to force downloa\u2026 \u00b7 owncloud/core@efa35d6 \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
