{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-6507", "Description": "An issue was discovered in AppArmor before 2.12. Incorrect handling of unknown AppArmor profiles in AppArmor init scripts, upstart jobs, and/or systemd unit files allows an attacker to possibly have increased attack surfaces of processes that were intended to be confined by AppArmor. This is due to the common logic to handle 'restart' operations removing AppArmor profiles that aren't found in the typical filesystem locations, such as /etc/apparmor.d/. Userspace projects that manage their own AppArmor profiles in atypical directories, such as what's done by LXD and Docker, are affected by this flaw in the AppArmor init script logic.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-6507", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nCanonical\u00bbUbuntu Core\u00bbVersion:15.04cpe:2.3:o:canonical:ubuntu_core:15.04:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nCanonical\u00bbUbuntu Touch\u00bbVersion:15.04cpe:2.3:o:canonical:ubuntu_touch:15.04:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nApparmor\u00bbApparmorVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.11cpe:2.3:a:apparmor:apparmor:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 57 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.21%  0.19%  -0.02 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.21%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/269/Improper-Privilege-Management.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugs.launchpad.net/apparmor/+bug/1668892", "ref_desc": "Bug #1668892 \u201cCVE-2017-6507: apparmor service restarts and packa...\u201d : Bugs : AppArmorIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2017/CVE-2017-6507.html", "ref_desc": "CVE-2017-6507 in UbuntuThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~apparmor-dev/apparmor/master/revision/3647", "ref_desc": "~apparmor-dev/apparmor/master : revision 3647Issue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/97223", "ref_desc": "Ubuntu AppArmor CVE-2017-6507 Security Bypass Vulnerability", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~apparmor-dev/apparmor/master/revision/3648", "ref_desc": "~apparmor-dev/apparmor/master : revision 3648Issue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
