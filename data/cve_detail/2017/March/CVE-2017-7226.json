{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-7226", "Description": "The pe_ILF_object_p function in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.28, is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer over-read of size 4049 because it uses the strlen function instead of strnlen, leading to program crashes in several utilities such as addr2line, size, and strings. It could lead to information disclosure as well.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-7226", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nGNU\u00bbBinutils\u00bbVersion:2.28cpe:2.3:a:gnu:binutils:2.28:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 58 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.22%  0.20%  -0.02 \n 2  2024-09-17  0.16%  0.22%  +0.06 \n 3  2024-04-25  0.15%  0.16%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-03-15  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 5  2024-02-09  0.22%  0.14%  -0.08 \n 6  2023-12-03  0.18%  0.22%  +0.04 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.18%  -0.71 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/125/Out-of-bounds-Read.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=20905", "ref_desc": "20905 \u2013 Heap buffer overflow in bfd/peicode.hIssue Tracking;Patch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
