{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-9471", "Description": "Revive Adserver before 3.2.5 and 4.0.0 suffers from Special Element Injection. Usernames weren't properly sanitised when creating users on a Revive Adserver instance. Especially, control characters were not filtered, allowing apparently identical usernames to co-exist in the system, due to the fact that such characters are normally ignored when an HTML page is displayed in a browser. The issue could have therefore been exploited for user spoofing, although elevated privileges are required to create users within Revive Adserver.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-9471", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nRevive-adserver\u00bbRevive AdserverVersions  up to, including, (<=) 3.2.4cpe:2.3:a:revive-adserver:revive_adserver:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nRevive-adserver\u00bbRevive Adserver\u00bbVersion:4.0.0cpe:2.3:a:revive-adserver:revive_adserver:4.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-75 Failure to Sanitize Special Elements into a Different Plane (Special Element Injection)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/75/Failure-to-Sanitize-Special-Elements-into-a-Different-Plane-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/revive-adserver/revive-adserver/commit/05b1eceb", "ref_desc": "Fix h1 report 128181 \u00b7 revive-adserver/revive-adserver@05b1ece \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.revive-adserver.com/security/revive-sa-2016-002/", "ref_desc": "Revive Adserver Security Advisory SA-2016-002Patch;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/l1fYbCe8h1QNC87CKjeR6F7VMrk.html"}]}
