{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-7200", "Description": "An SSRF issue was discovered in OpenStack Glance before Newton. The 'copy_from' feature in the Image Service API v1 allowed an attacker to perform masked network port scans. With v1, it is possible to create images with a URL such as 'http://localhost:22'. This could then allow an attacker to enumerate internal network details while appearing masked, since the scan would appear to originate from the Glance Image service.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-7200", "Vulnerability Categories": "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nOpenstack\u00bbGlanceVersions  up to, including, (<=) mitakacpe:2.3:a:openstack:glance:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 58 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.20%  0.20%  0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.20%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/918/Server-Side-Request-Forgery-SSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/OSSN/OSSN-0078", "ref_desc": "OSSN/OSSN-0078 - OpenStackVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/96988", "ref_desc": "OpenStack Glance CVE-2017-7200 Security Bypass VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugs.launchpad.net/ossn/+bug/1606495", "ref_desc": "Bug #1606495 \u201ccopy_from in api v1 allows network port scan\u201d : Bugs : OpenStack Security NotesThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugs.launchpad.net/ossn/+bug/1153614", "ref_desc": "Bug #1153614 \u201cAdd a policy to control copy-from functionality\u201d : Bugs : GlanceThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
