{"CVE Code": "CVE-2015-8994", "Description": "An issue was discovered in PHP 5.x and 7.x, when the configuration uses apache2handler/mod_php or php-fpm with OpCache enabled. With 5.x after 5.6.28 or 7.x after 7.0.13, the issue is resolved in a non-default configuration with the opcache.validate_permission=1 setting. The vulnerability details are as follows. In PHP SAPIs where PHP interpreters share a common parent process, Zend OpCache creates a shared memory object owned by the common parent during initialization. Child PHP processes inherit the SHM descriptor, using it to cache and retrieve compiled script bytecode (\"opcode\" in PHP jargon). Cache keys vary depending on configuration, but filename is a central key component, and compiled opcode can generally be run if a script's filename is known or can be guessed. Many common shared-hosting configurations change EUID in child processes to enforce privilege separation among hosted users (for example using mod_ruid2 for the Apache HTTP Server, or php-fpm user settings). In these scenarios, the default Zend OpCache behavior defeats script file permissions by sharing a single SHM cache among all child PHP processes. PHP scripts often contain sensitive information: Think of CMS configurations where reading or running another user's script usually means gaining privileges to the CMS database.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2015-8994", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPHP\u00bbPHPVersions  from including (>=) 5.0.0andup to, including, (<=) 5.6.29cpe:2.3:a:php:php:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPHP\u00bbPHPVersions  from including (>=) 7.0.0andbefore (<) 7.0.14cpe:2.3:a:php:php:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.83% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 88 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.45%  1.83%  +1.38 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.03%  0.45%  -0.59 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-264", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/264/cwe.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://ma.ttias.be/a-better-way-to-run-php-fpm/", "ref_desc": "A better way to run PHP-FPMExploit;Technical Description;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://marc.info/?l=php-internals&m=147876797317925&w=2", "ref_desc": "'[PHP-DEV] Re: [PATCH] opcache bug #69090, prepend user identifier to keys' - MARCMailing List", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=69090", "ref_desc": "PHP :: Request #69090 :: add prefix/xor to cache keys/check permissions or separate cachesExploit;Issue Tracking", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2017/q1/520", "ref_desc": "oss-sec: CVE Request: PHP with Zend OPCache code permission/sensitive data protection vulnerabilityMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q4/343", "ref_desc": "oss-sec: CVE Request: PHP with Zend OPCache code permission/sensitive data protection vulnerabilitiesMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/02/28/1", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Re: CVE Request: PHP with Zend OPCache code permission/sensitive data protection vulnerabilityMailing List", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://marc.info/?l=php-internals&m=147921016724565&w=2", "ref_desc": "'[PHP-DEV] Re: [PATCH] opcache bug #69090, prepend user identifier to keys' - MARCMailing List", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
