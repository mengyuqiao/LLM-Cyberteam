{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-0070", "Description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way affected Microsoft scripting engines render when handling objects in memory in Microsoft browsers. These vulnerabilities could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. This vulnerability is different from those described in CVE-2017-0010, CVE-2017-0015, CVE-2017-0032, CVE-2017-0035, CVE-2017-0067, CVE-2017-0071, CVE-2017-0094, CVE-2017-0131, CVE-2017-0132, CVE-2017-0133, CVE-2017-0134, CVE-2017-0136, CVE-2017-0137, CVE-2017-0138, CVE-2017-0141, CVE-2017-0150, and CVE-2017-0151.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-0070", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nMicrosoft\u00bbEdge\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:microsoft:edge:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows 10When used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows 10\u00bbVersion:1511When used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows 10\u00bbVersion:1607When used together with:Microsoft\u00bbWindows Server 2016\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "87.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 99 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  92.33%  87.14%  -5.19 \n 2  2024-03-29  93.00%  92.33%  -0.67 \n 3  2024-02-18  92.56%  93.00%  +0.44 \n 4  2024-01-05  95.35%  92.56%  -2.79 \n 5  2023-11-27  95.51%  95.35%  -0.16 \n 6  2023-10-18  95.42%  95.51%  +0.09 \n 7  2023-09-10  95.19%  95.42%  +0.23 \n 8  2023-08-01  95.02%  95.19%  +0.18 \n 9  2023-05-12  95.45%  95.02%  -0.43 \n 10  2023-03-07  88.00%  95.45%  +7.45 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-416 Use After Free", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/416/Use-After-Free.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-0070", "ref_desc": "CVE-2017-0070 | Scripting Engine Memory Corruption VulnerabilityPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41623/", "ref_desc": "Microsoft Edge 38.14393.0.0 - JavaScript Engine Use-After-Free", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/96690", "ref_desc": "Microsoft Edge CVE-2017-0070 Scripting Engine Remote Memory Corruption VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1038006", "ref_desc": "Microsoft Edge Multiple Flaws Let Remote Users Bypass Security Restrictions, Spoof URLs, Obtain Potentially Sensitive Information, and Execute Arbitrary Code - SecurityTrackerCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/xVCg9r5qcmb-PRGkTUDzpv2dB8c.html"}]}
