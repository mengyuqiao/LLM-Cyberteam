{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-6398", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Trend Micro InterScan Messaging Security (Virtual Appliance) 9.1-1600. An authenticated user can execute a terminal command in the context of the web server user (which is root). Besides, the default installation of IMSVA comes with default administrator credentials. The saveCert.imss endpoint takes several user inputs and performs blacklisting. After that, it uses them as arguments to a predefined operating-system command without proper sanitization. However, because of an improper blacklisting rule, it's possible to inject arbitrary commands into it.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-6398", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nTrendmicro\u00bbInterscan Messaging Security Virtual Appliance\u00bbVersion:9.1-1600cpe:2.3:a:trendmicro:interscan_messaging_security_virtual_appliance:9.1-1600:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "9.80% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 95 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  11.16%  9.80%  -1.36 \n 2  2023-03-07  12.32%  11.16%  -1.16 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/linux/http/trend_micro_imsva_exec", "ref_desc": "Trend Micro InterScan Messaging Security (Virtual Appliance) Remote Code Execution | Rapid7Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/96859", "ref_desc": "Trend Micro InterScan Messaging Security CVE-2017-6398 Remote Code Execution Vulnerability", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
