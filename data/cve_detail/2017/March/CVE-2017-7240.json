{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-7240", "Description": "An issue was discovered on Miele Professional PST10 devices. The corresponding embedded webserver \"PST10 WebServer\" typically listens to port 80 and is prone to a directory traversal attack; therefore, an unauthenticated attacker may be able to exploit this issue to access sensitive information to aide in subsequent attacks.
