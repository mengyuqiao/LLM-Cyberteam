{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-0034", "Description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Microsoft Edge improperly accesses objects in memory. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in a way that enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-0034", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nMicrosoft\u00bbEdgecpe:2.3:a:microsoft:edge:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "39.35% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 97 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  57.43%  39.35%  -18.08 \n 2  2024-02-18  53.20%  57.43%  +4.23 \n 3  2023-11-27  48.80%  53.20%  +4.40 \n 4  2023-08-01  44.74%  48.80%  +4.06 \n 5  2023-04-01  44.53%  44.74%  +0.21 \n 6  2023-03-07  39.32%  44.53%  +5.21 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-0034", "ref_desc": "CVE-2017-0034 | Scripting Engine Memory Corruption VulnerabilityPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1038006", "ref_desc": "Microsoft Edge Multiple Flaws Let Remote Users Bypass Security Restrictions, Spoof URLs, Obtain Potentially Sensitive Information, and Execute Arbitrary Code - SecurityTrackerCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/xVCg9r5qcmb-PRGkTUDzpv2dB8c.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/96786", "ref_desc": "Microsoft Edge CVE-2017-0034 Remote Memory Corruption Vulnerability", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
