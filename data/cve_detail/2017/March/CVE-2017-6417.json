{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-6417", "Description": "Code injection vulnerability in Avira Total Security Suite 15.0 (and earlier), Optimization Suite 15.0 (and earlier), Internet Security Suite 15.0 (and earlier), and Free Security Suite 15.0 (and earlier) allows a local attacker to bypass a self-protection mechanism, inject arbitrary code, and take full control of any Avira process via a \"DoubleAgent\" attack. One perspective on this issue is that (1) these products do not use the Protected Processes feature, and therefore an attacker can enter an arbitrary Application Verifier Provider DLL under Image File Execution Options in the registry; (2) the self-protection mechanism is intended to block all local processes (regardless of privileges) from modifying Image File Execution Options for these products; and (3) this mechanism can be bypassed by an attacker who temporarily renames Image File Execution Options during the attack.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-6417", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAvira\u00bbOptimization SuiteVersions  up to, including, (<=) 15.0cpe:2.3:a:avira:optimization_suite:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAvira\u00bbInternet Security SuiteVersions  up to, including, (<=) 15.0cpe:2.3:a:avira:internet_security_suite:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAvira\u00bbFree Security SuiteVersions  up to, including, (<=) 15.0cpe:2.3:a:avira:free_security_suite:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAvira\u00bbTotal Security SuiteVersions  up to, including, (<=) 15.0cpe:2.3:a:avira:total_security_suite:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.40%  0.04%  -1.36 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-427 Uncontrolled Search Path Element", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/427/Uncontrolled-Search-Path-Element.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://cybellum.com/doubleagent-taking-full-control-antivirus/", "ref_desc": "DoubleAgent: Taking Full Control Over Your Antivirus | CybellumThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/67WN6-aztJYOEWJiY7VuDTeDgME.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://cybellum.com/doubleagentzero-day-code-injection-and-persistence-technique/", "ref_desc": "DoubleAgent: Zero-Day Code Injection and Persistence Technique | CybellumTechnical Description;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/lRH17QFA4PZ3I8E-y_XzSAqUZiE.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/97021", "ref_desc": "Multiple Avira Products CVE-2017-6417 DLL Loading Local Code Injection VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
