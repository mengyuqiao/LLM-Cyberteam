{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-5566", "Description": "Code injection vulnerability in AVG Ultimate 17.1 (and earlier), AVG Internet Security 17.1 (and earlier), and AVG AntiVirus FREE 17.1 (and earlier) allows a local attacker to bypass a self-protection mechanism, inject arbitrary code, and take full control of any AVG process via a \"DoubleAgent\" attack. One perspective on this issue is that (1) these products do not use the Protected Processes feature, and therefore an attacker can enter an arbitrary Application Verifier Provider DLL under Image File Execution Options in the registry; (2) the self-protection mechanism is intended to block all local processes (regardless of privileges) from modifying Image File Execution Options for these products; and (3) this mechanism can be bypassed by an attacker who temporarily renames Image File Execution Options during the attack.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5566", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAVG\u00bbAnti-virus\u00bbVersion:17.1    FreeEditioncpe:2.3:a:avg:anti-virus:17.1:*:*:*:free:*:*:*Matching versions\nAVG\u00bbInternet Security\u00bbVersion:17.1cpe:2.3:a:avg:internet_security:17.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nAVG\u00bbUltimate\u00bbVersion:17.1cpe:2.3:a:avg:ultimate:17.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.40%  0.04%  -1.36 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-427 Uncontrolled Search Path Element", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/427/Uncontrolled-Search-Path-Element.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://cybellum.com/doubleagent-taking-full-control-antivirus/", "ref_desc": "DoubleAgent: Taking Full Control Over Your Antivirus | CybellumThird Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/67WN6-aztJYOEWJiY7VuDTeDgME.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/97022", "ref_desc": "Multiple AVG Products CVE-2017-5566 DLL Loading Local Code Injection VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://cybellum.com/doubleagentzero-day-code-injection-and-persistence-technique/", "ref_desc": "DoubleAgent: Zero-Day Code Injection and Persistence Technique | CybellumTechnical Description;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/lRH17QFA4PZ3I8E-y_XzSAqUZiE.html"}]}
