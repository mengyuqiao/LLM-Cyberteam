{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-9464", "Description": "Nextcloud Server before 9.0.54 and 10.0.0 suffers from an improper authorization check on removing shares. The Sharing Backend as implemented in Nextcloud does differentiate between shares to users and groups. In case of a received group share, users should be able to unshare the file to themselves but not to the whole group. The previous API implementation simply unshared the file to all users in the group.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-9464", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud ServerVersions  before (<) 9.0.54cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud Server\u00bbVersion:10.0UpdateRC1cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:10.0:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.16%  0.12%  -0.04 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.03%  0.16%  -0.87 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-285 Improper Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/285/Improper-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/server/commit/e2c4f4f9aa11bc92e8f2212cce73841b922187e8", "ref_desc": "Add intergration test \u00b7 nextcloud/server@e2c4f4f \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/97287", "ref_desc": "Nextcloud CVE-2016-9464 Unauthorized Access VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://nextcloud.com/security/advisory/?id=nc-sa-2016-007", "ref_desc": "advisory \u2013 NextcloudPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/server/commit/a5471b4a3e3f30e99e4de39c97c0c3b3c2f1618f", "ref_desc": "Do not allow to delete/update group shares as a group member \u00b7 nextcloud/server@a5471b4 \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/153905", "ref_desc": "#153905 IDOR - Disable sharingExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/server/commit/3387e5d00fcf6b2ea6b285a091e5743f545e7202", "ref_desc": "Add intergration test \u00b7 nextcloud/server@3387e5d \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/server/commit/7289cb5ec0b812992ab0dfb889744b94bc0994f0", "ref_desc": "Do not allow to delete/update group shares as a group member \u00b7 nextcloud/server@7289cb5 \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
