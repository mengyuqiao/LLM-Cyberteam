{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-2775", "Description": "An exploitable memory corruption vulnerability exists in the LvVariantUnflatten functionality in 64-bit versions of LabVIEW before 2015 SP1 f7 Patch and 2016 before f2 Patch. A specially crafted VI file can cause a user controlled value to be used as a loop terminator resulting in internal heap corruption. An attacker controlled VI file can be used to trigger this vulnerability, exploitation could lead to remote code execution.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-2775", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Memory Corruption;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nNI\u00bbLabview\u00bbVersion:16.0.0.49152cpe:2.3:a:ni:labview:16.0.0.49152:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "7.94% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 94 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  3.68%  7.94%  +4.26 \n 2  2023-08-16  3.18%  3.68%  +0.50 \n 3  2023-04-16  2.67%  3.18%  +0.51 \n 4  2023-03-11  2.31%  2.67%  +0.36 \n 5  2023-03-07  5.59%  2.31%  -3.29 \n 6  2023-02-09  4.97%  5.59%  +0.63 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.talosintelligence.com/reports/TALOS-2017-0269/", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2017-0269 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat IntelligenceExploit;Technical Description;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.ni.com/product-documentation/53778/en/", "ref_desc": "LabVIEW 64-bit LvVariantUnflatten Vulnerability - National Instruments", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/97020", "ref_desc": "Ni LabVIEW CVE-2017-2775 Memory Corruption VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
