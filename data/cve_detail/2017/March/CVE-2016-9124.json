{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-9124", "Description": "Revive Adserver before 3.2.3 suffers from Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts. The login page of Revive Adserver is vulnerable to password-guessing attacks. An account lockdown feature was considered, but rejected to avoid introducing service disruptions to regular users during such attacks. A random delay has instead been introduced as a countermeasure in case of password failures, along with a system to discourage parallel brute forcing. These systems will effectively allow the valid users to log in to the adserver, even while an attack is in progress.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-9124", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nRevive-adserver\u00bbRevive AdserverVersions  up to, including, (<=) 3.2.2cpe:2.3:a:revive-adserver:revive_adserver:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.38% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 73 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.32%  0.38%  +0.06 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.32%  -0.64 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-307 Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/307/Improper-Restriction-of-Excessive-Authentication-Attempts.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/96115", "ref_desc": "Sign inPermissions Required", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/revive-adserver/revive-adserver/commit/847941390f5b3310d51b07c92ec91cc1f4cc82c9", "ref_desc": "Mitigate h1 report 96115 \u00b7 revive-adserver/revive-adserver@8479413 \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.revive-adserver.com/security/revive-sa-2016-001/", "ref_desc": "Revive Adserver Security Advisory SA-2016-001Patch;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/Gd5mzA5wwlZ7f89ghhg2tBnq-OM.html"}]}
