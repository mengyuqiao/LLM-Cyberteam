{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-9463", "Description": "Nextcloud Server before 9.0.54 and 10.0.1 & ownCloud Server before 9.1.2, 9.0.6, and 8.2.9 suffer from SMB User Authentication Bypass. Nextcloud/ownCloud include an optional and not by default enabled SMB authentication component that allows authenticating users against an SMB server. This backend is implemented in a way that tries to connect to a SMB server and if that succeeded consider the user logged-in. The backend did not properly take into account SMB servers that have any kind of anonymous auth configured. This is the default on SMB servers nowadays and allows an unauthenticated attacker to gain access to an account without valid credentials. Note: The SMB backend is disabled by default and requires manual configuration in the Nextcloud/ownCloud config file. If you have not configured the SMB backend then you're not affected by this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-9463", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nOwncloud\u00bbOwncloudVersions  from including (>=) 9.1.0andbefore (<) 9.1.2cpe:2.3:a:owncloud:owncloud:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOwncloud\u00bbOwncloudVersions  from including (>=) 8.2.0andbefore (<) 8.2.9cpe:2.3:a:owncloud:owncloud:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOwncloud\u00bbOwncloudVersions  from including (>=) 9.0.0andbefore (<) 9.0.4cpe:2.3:a:owncloud:owncloud:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud ServerVersions  from including (>=) 10.0.0andbefore (<) 10.0.1cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nNextcloud\u00bbNextcloud ServerVersions  before (<) 9.0.54cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.38% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 73 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.39%  0.38%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-09-07  0.31%  0.39%  +0.09 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.54%  0.31%  -1.23 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-303 Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/303/Incorrect-Implementation-of-Authentication-Algorithm.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://owncloud.org/security/advisory/?id=oc-sa-2016-017", "ref_desc": "Security Advisories \u2013 ownCloudPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/148151", "ref_desc": "#148151 SMB User Authentication Bypass and PersistenceExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://nextcloud.com/security/advisory/?id=nc-sa-2016-006", "ref_desc": "advisory \u2013 NextcloudPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/owncloud/apps/commit/5d47e7b52646cf79edadd78ce10c754290cbb732", "ref_desc": "Merge pull request #2198 from owncloud/smb-auth-fix \u00b7 owncloud/apps@5d47e7b \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/apps/commit/b85ace6840b8a6704641086bc3b8eb8e81cb2274", "ref_desc": "Double verify the SMB response \u00b7 nextcloud/apps@b85ace6 \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/owncloud/apps/commit/a0e07b7ddd5a5fd850a6e07f8457d05b76a300b3", "ref_desc": "[stable8.2] Merge pull request #2198 from owncloud/smb-auth-fix \u00b7 owncloud/apps@a0e07b7 \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/owncloud/apps/commit/16cbccfc946c8711721fa684d78135ca1fb64791", "ref_desc": "[stable9] Merge pull request #2198 from owncloud/smb-auth-fix \u00b7 owncloud/apps@16cbccf \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nextcloud/apps/commit/decb91fd31f4ffab191cbf09ce4e5c55c67a4087", "ref_desc": "Double verify the SMB response \u00b7 nextcloud/apps@decb91f \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/2016/10/operation-ownedcloud-exploitation-post-exploitation-persistence/", "ref_desc": "Operation OwnedCloud: Exploitation and Post-exploitation Persistence - Rhino Security LabsExploit;Technical Description;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
