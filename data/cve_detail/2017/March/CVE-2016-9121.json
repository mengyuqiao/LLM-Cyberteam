{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-9121", "Description": "go-jose before 1.0.4 suffers from an invalid curve attack for the ECDH-ES algorithm. When deriving a shared key using ECDH-ES for an encrypted message, go-jose neglected to check that the received public key on a message is on the same curve as the static private key of the receiver, thus making it vulnerable to an invalid curve attack.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-9121", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGo-jose Project\u00bbGo-joseVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.0.3cpe:2.3:a:go-jose_project:go-jose:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.17% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.17%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-326 Inadequate Encryption Strength", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/326/Inadequate-Encryption-Strength.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/square/go-jose/commit/c7581939a3656bb65e89d64da0a52364a33d2507", "ref_desc": "Merge branch 'cs/164590' \u00b7 square/go-jose@c758193 \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/11/03/1", "ref_desc": "oss-security - CVE request: multiple issues in go-jose packageMailing List;Patch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/o9His287TXr_zYuFsFdcEv0Qy0k.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://hackerone.com/reports/164590", "ref_desc": "Sign inPermissions Required", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
