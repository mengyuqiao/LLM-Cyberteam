{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-5999", "Description": "An issue was discovered in sysPass 2.x before 2.1, in which an algorithm was never sufficiently reviewed by cryptographers. The fact that inc/SP/Core/Crypt.class is using the MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_256() function (the 256-bit block version of Rijndael, not AES) instead of MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_128 (real AES) could help an attacker to create unknown havoc in the remote system.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5999", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSyspass\u00bbSyspass\u00bbVersion:2.0cpe:2.3:a:syspass:syspass:2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 61 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.22%  0.24%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.22%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-326 Inadequate Encryption Strength", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/326/Inadequate-Encryption-Strength.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/96562", "ref_desc": "sysPass CVE-2017-5999 Cryptographic Security Bypass VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nuxsmin/sysPass/releases/tag/2.1.0.17022601", "ref_desc": "Release sysPass 2.1 \u00b7 nuxsmin/sysPass \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Release Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://cxsecurity.com/issue/WLB-2017020196", "ref_desc": "sysPass 2.0 risky cryptographic algorithm usage - CXSecurity.comThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/nuxsmin/sysPass/commit/a0e2c485e53b370a7cc6d833e192c3c5bfd70e1f", "ref_desc": "Merge branch 'crypt' \u00b7 nuxsmin/sysPass@a0e2c48 \u00b7 GitHubPatch", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
