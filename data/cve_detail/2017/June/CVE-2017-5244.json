{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-5244", "Description": "Routes used to stop running Metasploit tasks (either particular ones or all tasks) allowed GET requests. Only POST requests should have been allowed, as the stop/stop_all routes change the state of the service. This could have allowed an attacker to stop currently-running Metasploit tasks by getting an authenticated user to execute JavaScript. As of Metasploit 4.14.0 (Update 2017061301), the routes for stopping tasks only allow POST requests, which validate the presence of a secret token to prevent CSRF attacks.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5244", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nRapid7\u00bbMetasploitVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.13.19cpe:2.3:a:rapid7:metasploit:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 48 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.13%  +0.06 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.83 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.seekurity.com/blog/general/metasploit-web-project-kill-all-running-tasks-csrf-CVE-2017-5244/", "ref_desc": "Vulnerability in Metasploit Project aka CVE-2017-5244 \u2013 SeekurityThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://community.rapid7.com/community/metasploit/blog/2017/06/15/r7-2017-16-cve-2017-5244-lack-of-csrf-protection-for-stopping-tasks-in-metasploit-pro-express-and-community-editions-fixed", "ref_desc": "Help @ Rapid7Exploit;VDB Entry;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/99082", "ref_desc": "Multiple Rapid7 Metasploit Editions CVE-2017-5244 Cross Site Request Forgery VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
