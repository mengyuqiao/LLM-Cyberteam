{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-1000378", "Description": "The NetBSD qsort() function is recursive, and not randomized, an attacker can construct a pathological input array of N elements that causes qsort() to deterministically recurse N/4 times. This allows attackers to consume arbitrary amounts of stack memory and manipulate stack memory to assist in arbitrary code execution attacks. This affects NetBSD 7.1 and possibly earlier versions.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-1000378", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNetbsd\u00bbNetbsdVersions  up to, including, (<=) 7.1cpe:2.3:o:netbsd:netbsd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.52% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 77 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.58%  0.52%  -0.06 \n 2  2023-05-30  0.59%  0.58%  -0.01 \n 3  2023-04-29  0.59%  0.59%  0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  2.58%  0.59%  -1.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/src/lib/libc/stdlib/qsort.c?rev=1.23&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup", "ref_desc": "src/lib/libc/stdlib/qsort.c - view - 1.23Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/99255", "ref_desc": "NetBSD CVE-2017-1000378 Arbitrary Code Execution VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.qualys.com/2017/06/19/stack-clash/stack-clash.txt", "ref_desc": "Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/VfD1GuJSgRjrqAUikrI85PvulPk.html"}]}
