{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-9502", "Description": "In curl before 7.54.1 on Windows and DOS, libcurl's default protocol function, which is the logic that allows an application to set which protocol libcurl should attempt to use when given a URL without a scheme part, had a flaw that could lead to it overwriting a heap based memory buffer with seven bytes. If the default protocol is specified to be FILE or a file: URL lacks two slashes, the given \"URL\" starts with a drive letter, and libcurl is built for Windows or DOS, then libcurl would copy the path 7 bytes off, so that the end of the given path would write beyond the malloc buffer (7 bytes being the length in bytes of the ascii string \"file://\").", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-9502", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nHaxx\u00bbCurlVersions  up to, including, (<=) 7.54.0cpe:2.3:a:haxx:curl:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.22% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-30  0.28%  0.22%  -0.06 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.28%  -0.74 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1038697", "ref_desc": "libcurl 'file' Protocol Buffer Overflow Lets Local Users Execute Arbitrary Code - SecurityTracker", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/06/14/1", "ref_desc": "oss-security - [SECURITY ADVISORY] curl: URL file scheme drive letter buffer overflowMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/99120", "ref_desc": "cURL/libcURL 'b/lib/url.c' Heap Based Buffer Overflow VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20170614.html", "ref_desc": "curl - URL file scheme drive letter buffer overflow - CVE-2017-9502Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
