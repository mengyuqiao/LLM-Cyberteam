{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-9780", "Description": "In Flatpak before 0.8.7, a third-party app repository could include malicious apps that contain files with inappropriate permissions, for example setuid or world-writable. The files are deployed with those permissions, which would let a local attacker run the setuid executable or write to the world-writable location. In the case of the \"system helper\" component, files deployed as part of the app are owned by root, so in the worst case they could be setuid root.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-9780", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:9.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nFlatpak\u00bbFlatpakVersions  up to, including, (<=) 0.8.6cpe:2.3:a:flatpak:flatpak:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.04%  -0.91 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/732/Incorrect-Permission-Assignment-for-Critical-Resource.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugs.debian.org/865413", "ref_desc": "#865413 - flatpak: CVE-2017-9780: Flatpak security issue - Debian Bug report logsIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/99346", "ref_desc": "Flatpak CVE-2017-9780 Local Privilege Escalation VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/issues/845", "ref_desc": "handling suid/world-writable content \u00b7 Issue #845 \u00b7 flatpak/flatpak \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3895", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-3895-1 flatpakThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
