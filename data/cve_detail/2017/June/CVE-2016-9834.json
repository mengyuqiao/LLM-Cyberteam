{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-9834", "Description": "An XSS vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary client side script on vulnerable installations of Sophos Cyberoam firewall devices with firmware through 10.6.4. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the handling of a request to the \"LiveConnectionDetail.jsp\" application. GET parameters \"applicationname\" and \"username\" are improperly sanitized allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript into the page. This can be abused by an attacker to perform a cross-site scripting attack on the user. A vulnerable URI is /corporate/webpages/trafficdiscovery/LiveConnectionDetail.jsp.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-9834", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nSophos\u00bbCyberoam FirmwareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 10.6.4cpe:2.3:o:sophos:cyberoam_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Sophos\u00bbCyberoam\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 29 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.06%  -0.03 \n 2  2024-03-28  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  2.17%  0.10%  -2.08 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2017/Jun/4", "ref_desc": "Bugtraq: Sophos Cyberoam Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilityMailing List;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
