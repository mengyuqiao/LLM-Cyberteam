{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-7180", "Description": "Net Monitor for Employees Pro through 5.3.4 has an unquoted service path, which allows a Security Feature Bypass of its documented \"Block applications\" design goal. The local attacker must have privileges to write to program.exe in a protected directory, such as the %SYSTEMDRIVE% directory, and thus the issue is not interpreted as a direct privilege escalation. However, the local attacker might have the goal of executing program.exe even though program.exe is a blocked application.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-7180", "Vulnerability Categories": "Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nEduiq\u00bbNet Monitor For Employees\u00bb     ProfessionalEditionVersions  up to, including, (<=) 5.3.4cpe:2.3:a:eduiq:net_monitor_for_employees:*:*:*:*:professional:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 25 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.83%  0.06%  -1.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-428 Unquoted Search Path or Element", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/428/Unquoted-Search-Path-or-Element.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/42141/", "ref_desc": "Net Monitor for Employees Pro < 5.3.4 - Unquoted Service Path Privilege EscalationThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
