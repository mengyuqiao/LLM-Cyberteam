{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-6325", "Description": "The Symantec Messaging Gateway can encounter a file inclusion vulnerability, which is a type of vulnerability that is most commonly found to affect web applications that rely on a scripting run time. This issue is caused when an application builds a path to executable code using an attacker-controlled variable in a way that allows the attacker to control which file is executed at run time. This file inclusion vulnerability subverts how an application loads code for execution. Successful exploitation of a file inclusion vulnerability will result in remote code execution on the web server that runs the affected web application.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-6325", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nSymantec\u00bbMessaging GatewayVersions  up to, including, (<=) 10.6.2cpe:2.3:a:symantec:messaging_gateway:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.67% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 80 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.58%  0.67%  +0.09 \n 2  2023-11-11  0.67%  0.58%  -0.09 \n 3  2023-10-01  0.55%  0.67%  +0.11 \n 4  2023-08-22  0.89%  0.55%  -0.34 \n 5  2023-06-06  0.63%  0.89%  +0.26 \n 6  2023-05-06  0.62%  0.63%  +0.01 \n 7  2023-03-07  4.70%  0.62%  -4.08 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.symantec.com/security_response/securityupdates/detail.jsp?fid=security_advisory&pvid=security_advisory&year=&suid=20170621_00", "ref_desc": "Symantec Messaging Gateway Multiple VulnerabilitiesVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/jEH1WDG1gbECXJ2jk530DsC3HuY.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/98890", "ref_desc": "Symantec Messaging Gateway CVE-2017-6325 Local File Include VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1038785", "ref_desc": "Symantec Messaging Gateway Multiple Flaws Let Remote Users Bypass Security Restrictions and Execute Arbitrary Code - SecurityTrackerCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/yjzbx9a51_WWClGeY8vxnWfU6cQ.html"}]}
