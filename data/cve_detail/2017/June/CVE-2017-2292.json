{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-2292", "Description": "Versions of MCollective prior to 2.10.4 deserialized YAML from agents without calling safe_load, allowing the potential for arbitrary code execution on the server. The fix for this is to call YAML.safe_load on input. This has been tested in all Puppet-supplied MCollective plugins, but there is a chance that third-party plugins could rely on this insecure behavior.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-2292", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPuppet\u00bbMcollective\u00bbForPuppetVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.10.3cpe:2.3:a:puppet:mcollective:*:*:*:*:*:puppet:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 36 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.58%  0.09%  -1.49 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://puppet.com/security/cve/cve-2017-2292", "ref_desc": "CVE-2017-2292 - MCollective Remote Code Execution Via YAML Deserialization | PuppetVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201709-01", "ref_desc": "MCollective: Remote Code Execution (GLSA 201709-01) \u2014 Gentoo security", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
