{"CVE Code": "CVE-2015-9098", "Description": "In Redgate SQL Monitor before 3.10 and 4.x before 4.2, a remote attacker can gain unauthenticated access to the Base Monitor, resulting in the ability to execute arbitrary SQL commands on any monitored Microsoft SQL Server machines. If the Base Monitor is connecting to these machines using an account with SQL admin privileges, then code execution on the operating system can result in full system compromise (if Microsoft SQL Server is running with local administrator privileges).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2015-9098", "Vulnerability Categories": "Sql Injection", "Affected Products": "\nRed-gate\u00bbSql MonitorVersions  up to, including, (<=) 3.5cpe:2.3:a:red-gate:sql_monitor:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nRed-gate\u00bbSql Monitor\u00bbVersion:4.0cpe:2.3:a:red-gate:sql_monitor:4.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nRed-gate\u00bbSql Monitor\u00bbVersion:4.1cpe:2.3:a:red-gate:sql_monitor:4.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.88% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 88 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  5.67%  1.88%  -3.80 \n 2  2024-01-24  5.77%  5.67%  -0.09 \n 3  2023-09-26  6.23%  5.77%  -0.46 \n 4  2023-07-08  7.31%  6.23%  -1.08 \n 5  2023-06-02  10.46%  7.31%  -3.16 \n 6  2023-05-02  9.09%  10.46%  +1.37 \n 7  2023-03-07  5.37%  9.09%  +3.73 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/89/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-SQL-C.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.red-gate.com/products/dba/sql-monitor/entrypage/security-vulnerability", "ref_desc": "Security Vulnerability In SQL MonitorVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/42444/", "ref_desc": "Red-Gate SQL Monitor < 3.10 / 4.2 - Authentication BypassThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
