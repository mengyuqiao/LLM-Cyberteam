{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-6639", "Description": "A vulnerability in the role-based access control (RBAC) functionality of Cisco Prime Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information or execute arbitrary code with root privileges on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to the lack of authentication and authorization mechanisms for a debugging tool that was inadvertently enabled in the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by remotely connecting to the debugging tool via TCP. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access sensitive information about the affected software or execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the affected system. This vulnerability affects Cisco Prime Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) Software Releases 10.1(1) and 10.1(2) for Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Virtual Appliance platforms.
