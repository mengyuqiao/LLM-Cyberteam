{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-2829", "Description": "An exploitable directory traversal vulnerability exists in the web management interface used by the Foscam C1 Indoor HD Camera running application firmware 2.52.2.37. A specially crafted HTTP request can cause the application to read a file from disk but a failure to adequately filter characters results in allowing an attacker to specify a file outside of a directory. An attacker can simply send an HTTP request to the device to trigger this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-2829", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal", "Affected Products": "\nFoscam\u00bbC1 Indoor Hd Camera Firmware\u00bbVersion:2.52.2.37cpe:2.3:o:foscam:c1_indoor_hd_camera_firmware:2.52.2.37:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Foscam\u00bbC1 Indoor Hd Camera\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 44 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.11%  +0.04 \n 2  2023-05-08  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 3  2023-04-06  0.10%  0.07%  -0.03 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/99250", "ref_desc": "Foscam IP Video Camera CVE-2017-2829 Directory Traversal VulnerabilityBroken Link", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2017-0330", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2017-0330 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat IntelligenceExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
