{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-14604", "Description": "GNOME Nautilus before 3.23.90 allows attackers to spoof a file type by using the .desktop file extension, as demonstrated by an attack in which a .desktop file's Name field ends in .pdf but this file's Exec field launches a malicious \"sh -c\" command. In other words, Nautilus provides no UI indication that a file actually has the potentially unsafe .desktop extension; instead, the UI only shows the .pdf extension. One (slightly) mitigating factor is that an attack requires the .desktop file to have execute permission. The solution is to ask the user to confirm that the file is supposed to be treated as a .desktop file, and then remember the user's answer in the metadata::trusted field.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-14604", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:8.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:9.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:10.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nGnome\u00bbNautilusVersions  before (<) 3.23.90cpe:2.3:a:gnome:nautilus:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.11% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 45 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.12%  0.11%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-11-12  0.17%  0.12%  -0.05 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.28%  0.17%  -1.11 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:0223", "ref_desc": "RHSA-2018:0223 - Security Advisory - Red Hat Customer PortalThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101012", "ref_desc": "GNOME Nautilus CVE-2017-14604 Arbitrary Command Execution VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=777991", "ref_desc": "Bug 777991 \u2013 Nautilus hides filename for .desktop files with execute permissionIssue Tracking;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://micahflee.com/2017/04/breaking-the-security-model-of-subgraph-os/", "ref_desc": "Breaking the Security Model of Subgraph OSExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=860268", "ref_desc": "#860268 - nautilus: CVE-2017-14604: .desktop files can hide malware in Nautilus - Debian Bug report logsIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/GNOME/nautilus/commit/1630f53481f445ada0a455e9979236d31a8d3bb0", "ref_desc": "mime-actions: use file metadata for trusting desktop files \u00b7 GNOME/nautilus@1630f53 \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/GNOME/nautilus/commit/bc919205bf774f6af3fa7154506c46039af5a69b", "ref_desc": "release: prepare for 3.23.90 \u00b7 GNOME/nautilus@bc91920 \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/issues/2238", "ref_desc": "Investigate potential attempt to compromise SVS \u00b7 Issue #2238 \u00b7 freedomofpress/securedrop \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3994", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-3994-1 nautilusThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
