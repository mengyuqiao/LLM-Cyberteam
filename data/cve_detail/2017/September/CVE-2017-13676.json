{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-13676", "Description": "Norton Remove & Reinstall can be susceptible to a DLL preloading vulnerability. These types of issues occur when an application looks to call a DLL for execution and an attacker provides a malicious DLL to use instead. Depending on how the application is configured, it will generally follow a specific search path to locate the DLL. The vulnerability can be exploited by a simple file write (or potentially an over-write) which results in a foreign DLL running under the context of the application. A Norton Remove & Reinstall update, version 4.4.0.58, has been released which addresses the aforementioned vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-13676", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nNorton\u00bbRemove & ReinstallVersions  up to, including, (<=) -cpe:2.3:a:norton:remove_\\&_reinstall:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.10%  0.04%  -1.06 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.4", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/100939", "ref_desc": "Symantec Norton Remove and Reinstall DLL Loading CVE-2017-13676 Local Code Execution VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.symantec.com/security_response/securityupdates/detail.jsp?fid=security_advisory&pvid=security_advisory&year=&suid=20170926_00", "ref_desc": "Norton Remove and Reinstall DLL PreloadingMitigation;VDB Entry;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
