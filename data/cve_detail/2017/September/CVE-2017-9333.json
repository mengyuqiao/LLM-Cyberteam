{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-9333", "Description": "OpenWebif 1.2.5 allows remote code execution via a URL to the CallOPKG function in the IpkgController class in plugin/controllers/ipkg.py, when the URL refers to an attacker-controlled web site with a Trojan horse package. This has security implications in cases where untrusted users can trigger CallOPKG calls, and these users can enter an arbitrary URL in an input field, even though that input field was only intended for a package name. This threat model may be relevant in the latest versions of third-party products that bundle OpenWebif, i.e., set-top box products. The issue of Trojan horse packages does NOT have security implications in cases where the attacker has full OpenWebif access.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-9333", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nOpenwebif Project\u00bbOpenwebif\u00bbVersion:1.2.5cpe:2.3:a:openwebif_project:openwebif:1.2.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.89% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 82 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.06%  0.89%  -0.18 \n 2  2024-04-21  0.87%  1.06%  +0.19 \n 3  2023-12-22  0.84%  0.87%  +0.04 \n 4  2023-07-28  0.82%  0.84%  +0.02 \n 5  2023-03-07  1.85%  0.82%  -1.03 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/E2OpenPlugins/e2openplugin-OpenWebif/issues/619", "ref_desc": "Remote code execution via IpkgController improper input validation. \u00b7 Issue #619 \u00b7 E2OpenPlugins/e2openplugin-OpenWebif \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/E2OpenPlugins/e2openplugin-OpenWebif/issues/621", "ref_desc": "Bandit Output \u00b7 Issue #621 \u00b7 E2OpenPlugins/e2openplugin-OpenWebif \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
