{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-7649", "Description": "The network enabled distribution of Kura before 2.1.0 takes control over the device's firewall setup but does not allow IPv6 firewall rules to be configured. Still the Equinox console port 5002 is left open, allowing to log into Kura without any user credentials over unencrypted telnet and executing commands using the Equinox \"exec\" command. As the process is running as \"root\" full control over the device can be acquired. IPv6 is also left in auto-configuration mode, accepting router advertisements automatically and assigns a MAC address based IPv6 address.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-7649", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nEclipse\u00bbKuraVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.0.2cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:kura:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 56 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-05-08  0.27%  0.19%  -0.08 \n 2  2023-05-01  0.23%  0.27%  +0.04 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.23%  -0.66 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=514681", "ref_desc": "514681 \u2013 (CVE-2017-7649) CVE-2017-7649: Remote code execution vulnerability over IPv6Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/eclipse/kura/issues/956", "ref_desc": "[Sec] Kura firewall rules bypassed with IPv6 \u00b7 Issue #956 \u00b7 eclipse/kura \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
