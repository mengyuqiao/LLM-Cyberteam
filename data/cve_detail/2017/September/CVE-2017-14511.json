{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-14511", "Description": "An issue was discovered in SAP E-Recruiting (aka ERECRUIT) 605 through 617. When an external applicant registers to the E-Recruiting application, he/she receives a link by email to confirm access to the provided email address. However, this measure can be bypassed and attackers can register and confirm email addresses that they do not have access to (candidate_hrobject is predictable and corr_act_guid is improperly validated). Furthermore, since an email address can be registered only once, an attacker could prevent other legitimate users from registering. This is SAP Security Note 2507798.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-14511", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nSAP\u00bbE-recruiting\u00bbVersion:616cpe:2.3:a:sap:e-recruiting:616:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSAP\u00bbE-recruiting\u00bbVersion:605cpe:2.3:a:sap:e-recruiting:605:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSAP\u00bbE-recruiting\u00bbVersion:606cpe:2.3:a:sap:e-recruiting:606:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nSAP\u00bbE-recruiting\u00bbVersion:617cpe:2.3:a:sap:e-recruiting:617:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 63 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.29%  0.24%  -0.05 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.29%  -0.67 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://blogs.sap.com/2017/09/12/sap-security-patch-day-september-2017/", "ref_desc": "SAP Security Patch Day \u2013 September 2017 | SAP BlogsVendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/CWblvauq2CevfIqvQzdg8b7MW4k.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.sec-consult.com/en/blog/advisories/email-verification-bypass-in-sap-e-recruiting/index.html", "ref_desc": "Email verification bypass in SAP E-Recruiting \u2013 SEC ConsultThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2507798", "ref_desc": "SAP ONE Support Launchpad: Log OnPermissions Required;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
