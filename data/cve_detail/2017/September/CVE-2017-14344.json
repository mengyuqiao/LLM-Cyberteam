{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-14344", "Description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on Jungo WinDriver 12.4.0 and earlier. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the processing of IOCTL 0x95382673 by the windrvr1240 kernel driver. The issue lies in the failure to properly validate user-supplied data which can result in a kernel pool overflow. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of kernel.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-14344", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nJungo\u00bbWindriverVersions  up to, including, (<=) 12.5.1cpe:2.3:a:jungo:windriver:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  2.11%  0.07%  -2.04 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/42665/", "ref_desc": "Jungo DriverWizard WinDriver < 12.4.0 - Kernel Pool Overflow / Local Privilege Escalation (2)Exploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://srcincite.io/advisories/src-2017-0027/", "ref_desc": "Source InciteThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
