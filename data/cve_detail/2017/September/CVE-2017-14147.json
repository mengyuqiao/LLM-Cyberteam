{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-14147", "Description": "An issue was discovered on FiberHome User End Routers Bearing Model Number AN1020-25 which could allow an attacker to easily restore a router to its factory settings by simply browsing to the link http://[Default-Router-IP]/restoreinfo.cgi & execute it. Due to improper authentication on this page, the software accepts the request hence allowing attacker to reset the router to its default configurations which later could allow attacker to login to router by using default username/password.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-14147", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nFiberhome\u00bbAdsl An1020-25 Firmware\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:o:fiberhome:adsl_an1020-25_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Fiberhome\u00bbAdsl An1020-25\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "66.27% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 98 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  80.73%  66.27%  -14.46 \n 2  2023-12-12  84.29%  80.73%  -3.56 \n 3  2023-08-18  87.13%  84.29%  -2.84 \n 4  2023-06-23  88.32%  87.13%  -1.18 \n 5  2023-03-07  8.38%  88.32%  +79.93 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/144022/FiberHome-Unauthenticated-ADSL-Router-Factory-Reset.html", "ref_desc": "FiberHome Unauthenticated ADSL Router Factory Reset \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://beefaaubee09.github.io/fiberhome-adsls-dos/", "ref_desc": "FiberHome ADSL Router Vulnerability DOS \u2013 Ibad Shah \u2013 Information Security | Application Development | Server Side Adminstration", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/42649/", "ref_desc": "FiberHome ADSL AN1020-25 - Improper Access RestrictionsExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
