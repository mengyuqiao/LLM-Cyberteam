{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-14222", "Description": "In libavformat/mov.c in FFmpeg 3.3.3, a DoS in read_tfra() due to lack of an EOF (End of File) check might cause huge CPU and memory consumption. When a crafted MOV file, which claims a large \"item_count\" field in the header but does not contain sufficient backing data, is provided, the loop would consume huge CPU and memory resources, since there is no EOF check inside the loop.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-14222", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nFfmpeg\u00bbFfmpeg\u00bbVersion:3.3.3cpe:2.3:a:ffmpeg:ffmpeg:3.3.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.28% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 68 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.18%  0.28%  +0.11 \n 2  2023-05-08  0.19%  0.18%  -0.01 \n 3  2023-04-28  0.35%  0.19%  -0.16 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.35%  -0.60 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-834 Excessive Iteration", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/834/Excessive-Iteration.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/100701", "ref_desc": "FFmpeg 'libavformat/mov.c' Denial of Service VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/commit/9cb4eb772839c5e1de2855d126bf74ff16d13382", "ref_desc": "avformat/mov: Fix DoS in read_tfra() \u00b7 FFmpeg/FFmpeg@9cb4eb7 \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3996", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-3996-1 ffmpegCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/GpKmtSlYUxgynyzvGhtJuf8iCOo.html"}]}
