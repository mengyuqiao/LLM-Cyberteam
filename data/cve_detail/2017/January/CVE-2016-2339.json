{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-2339", "Description": "An exploitable heap overflow vulnerability exists in the Fiddle::Function.new \"initialize\" function functionality of Ruby. In Fiddle::Function.new \"initialize\" heap buffer \"arg_types\" allocation is made based on args array length. Specially constructed object passed as element of args array can increase this array size after mentioned allocation and cause heap overflow.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-2339", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nRuby-lang\u00bbRuby\u00bbVersion:2.2.2cpe:2.3:a:ruby-lang:ruby:2.2.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nRuby-lang\u00bbRuby\u00bbVersion:2.3.0cpe:2.3:a:ruby-lang:ruby:2.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "1.39% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 86 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  1.05%  1.39%  +0.34 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.95%  1.05%  +0.10 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.talosintelligence.com/reports/TALOS-2016-0034/", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2016-0034 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat IntelligenceExploit;Technical Description;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/07/msg00012.html", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] [DLA 1421-1] ruby2.1 security updateCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/hJDciuaqUjQKA9Uu81alHl42_qs.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/91234", "ref_desc": "Ruby 'initialize()' Function Heap Buffer Overflow Vulnerability", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
