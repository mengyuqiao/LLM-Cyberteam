{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-5544", "Description": "An issue was discovered on FiberHome Fengine S5800 switches V210R240. An unauthorized attacker can access the device's SSH service, using a password cracking tool to establish SSH connections quickly. This will trigger an increase in the SSH login timeout (each of the login attempts will occupy a connection slot for a longer time). Once this occurs, legitimate login attempts via SSH/telnet will be refused, resulting in a denial of service; you must restart the device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5544", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nFiberhome\u00bbFengine S5800 Firmware\u00bbVersion:V210r240cpe:2.3:o:fiberhome:fengine_s5800_firmware:v210r240:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Fiberhome\u00bbFengine 28f-s\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Fiberhome\u00bbFengine 52f-s\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Fiberhome\u00bbFengine 52t-s\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Fiberhome\u00bbFengine S5800-28t-s\u00bbVersion:N/AWhen used together with:Fiberhome\u00bbFengine S5800-28t-s-pe\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.11%  0.10%  -0.02 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.11%  -0.77 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/400/Uncontrolled-Resource-Consumption.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/95708", "ref_desc": "FiberHome Fengine S5800 Switches CVE-2017-5544 Denial of Service VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
