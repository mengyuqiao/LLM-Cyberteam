{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-3269", "Description": "Vulnerability in the Oracle Outside In Technology component of Oracle Fusion Middleware (subcomponent: Outside In Filters). Supported versions that are affected are 8.5.2 and 8.5.3. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle Outside In Technology. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of Oracle Outside In Technology. Note: Outside In Technology is a suite of software development kits (SDKs). The protocol and CVSS score depend on the software that uses the Outside In Technology code. The CVSS score assumes that the software passes data received over a network directly to Outside In Technology code, but if data is not received over a network the CVSS score may be lower. CVSS v3.0 Base Score 7.5 (Availability impacts).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-3269", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nOracle\u00bbOutside In Technology\u00bbVersion:8.5.2cpe:2.3:a:oracle:outside_in_technology:8.5.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nOracle\u00bbOutside In Technology\u00bbVersion:8.5.3cpe:2.3:a:oracle:outside_in_technology:8.5.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.13% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 49 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.17%  0.13%  -0.04 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.17%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/95524", "ref_desc": "Oracle Outside In Technology CVE-2017-3269 Remote Security VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1037631", "ref_desc": "Oracle Fusion Middleware Bugs Let Remote Users Access and Modify Data and Deny Service - SecurityTrackerCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/8L68faw0XsAf_3MCNWihXdL11QI.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujan2017-2881727.html", "ref_desc": "Oracle Critical Patch Update - January 2017Patch;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/G3aDIbHHhoPA6mzK7PCMMUmJhQo.html"}]}
