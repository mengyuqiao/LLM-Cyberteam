{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-10043", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Radisys MRF Web Panel (SWMS) 9.0.1. The MSM_MACRO_NAME POST parameter in /swms/ms.cgi was discovered to be vulnerable to OS command injection attacks. It is possible to use the pipe character (|) to inject arbitrary OS commands and retrieve the output in the application's responses. Attackers could execute unauthorized commands, which could then be used to disable the software, or read, write, and modify data for which the attacker does not have permissions to access directly. Since the targeted application is directly executing the commands instead of the attacker, any malicious activities may appear to come from the application or the application's owner (apache user).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-10043", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMRF\u00bbWeb Panel\u00bbVersion:9.0.1cpe:2.3:a:mrf:web_panel:9.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "4.31% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 92 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  2.68%  4.31%  +1.63 \n 2  2024-08-15  3.17%  2.68%  -0.49 \n 3  2023-03-07  8.38%  3.17%  -5.21 ", "CVSS Scores": "10.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/78/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-an-OS-Co.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41179/", "ref_desc": "Radisys MRF - Command InjectionExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
