{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-9553", "Description": "The Sophos Web Appliance (version 4.2.1.3) is vulnerable to two Remote Command Injection vulnerabilities affecting its web administrative interface. These vulnerabilities occur in the MgrReport.php (/controllers/MgrReport.php) component responsible for blocking and unblocking IP addresses from accessing the device. The device doesn't properly escape the information passed in the variables 'unblockip' and 'blockip' before calling the shell_exec() function which allows for system commands to be injected into the device. The code erroneously suggests that the information handled is protected by utilizing the variable name 'escapedips' - however this was not the case. The Sophos ID is NSWA-1258.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-9553", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSophos\u00bbWeb Appliance\u00bbVersion:4.2.1.3cpe:2.3:a:sophos:web_appliance:4.2.1.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "4.84% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 93 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  3.62%  4.84%  +1.22 \n 2  2024-08-12  4.25%  3.62%  -0.63 \n 3  2024-03-22  3.28%  4.25%  +0.97 \n 4  2023-03-07  8.08%  3.28%  -4.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://swa.sophos.com/rn/swa/concepts/ReleaseNotes_4.3.1.html", "ref_desc": "Version 4.3.1 Release NotesRelease Notes", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/95853", "ref_desc": "Sophos Web Appliance CVE-2016-9553 Multiple Remote Command Injection VulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://pastebin.com/DUYuN0U5", "ref_desc": "[Ruby] # Exploit Title: Sophos Web Appliance UnBlock/Block-IP Remote Command Injection - Pastebin.comExploit", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://community.sophos.com/products/web-appliance/b/blog/posts/release-of-swa-version-4-3-1", "ref_desc": "Release of SWA version 4.3.1 - Blog - Web Appliance - Sophos CommunityRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/yrHr8GcKQXA3HkWPpZr_FDR9GOE.html"}]}
