{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-5554", "Description": "An issue was discovered in ABOOT in OnePlus 3 and 3T OxygenOS before 4.0.2. The attacker can reboot the device into the fastboot mode, which could be done without any authentication. A physical attacker can press the \"Volume Up\" button during device boot, where an attacker with ADB access can issue the adb reboot bootloader command. Then, the attacker can put the platform's SELinux in permissive mode, which severely weakens it, by issuing: fastboot oem selinux permissive.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5554", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nOneplus\u00bbOxygenosVersions  up to, including, (<=) 3.2.8cpe:2.3:o:oneplus:oxygenos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Oneplus\u00bbOneplus 3\u00bbVersion:N/A\nOneplus\u00bbOxygenosVersions  up to, including, (<=) 3.5.4cpe:2.3:o:oneplus:oxygenos:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Oneplus\u00bbOneplus 3t\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.63% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 79 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.44%  0.63%  +0.19 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.44%  -0.52 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.xda-developers.com/oneplus-33t-bootloader-vulnerability-allows-changing-of-selinux-to-permissive-mode-in-fastboot/", "ref_desc": "OnePlus 3/3T Bootloader Vulnerability Allows Changing of SELinux to Permissive Mode in FastbootThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/95706", "ref_desc": "OnePlus 3 and 3T CVE-2017-5554 Local Denial of Service VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://securityresear.ch/2017/01/11/fastboot-oem-selinux-permissive/", "ref_desc": "fastboot oem selinux permissive - securityresear.chThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
