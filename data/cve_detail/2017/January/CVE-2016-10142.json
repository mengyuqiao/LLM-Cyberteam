{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-10142", "Description": "An issue was discovered in the IPv6 protocol specification, related to ICMP Packet Too Big (PTB) messages. (The scope of this CVE is all affected IPv6 implementations from all vendors.) The security implications of IP fragmentation have been discussed at length in [RFC6274] and [RFC7739]. An attacker can leverage the generation of IPv6 atomic fragments to trigger the use of fragmentation in an arbitrary IPv6 flow (in scenarios in which actual fragmentation of packets is not needed) and can subsequently perform any type of fragmentation-based attack against legacy IPv6 nodes that do not implement [RFC6946]. That is, employing fragmentation where not actually needed allows for fragmentation-based attack vectors to be employed, unnecessarily. We note that, unfortunately, even nodes that already implement [RFC6946] can be subject to DoS attacks as a result of the generation of IPv6 atomic fragments. Let us assume that Host A is communicating with Host B and that, as a result of the widespread dropping of IPv6 packets that contain extension headers (including fragmentation) [RFC7872], some intermediate node filters fragments between Host B and Host A. If an attacker sends a forged ICMPv6 PTB error message to Host B, reporting an MTU smaller than 1280, this will trigger the generation of IPv6 atomic fragments from that moment on (as required by [RFC2460]). When Host B starts sending IPv6 atomic fragments (in response to the received ICMPv6 PTB error message), these packets will be dropped, since we previously noted that IPv6 packets with extension headers were being dropped between Host B and Host A. Thus, this situation will result in a DoS scenario. Another possible scenario is that in which two BGP peers are employing IPv6 transport and they implement Access Control Lists (ACLs) to drop IPv6 fragments (to avoid control-plane attacks). If the aforementioned BGP peers drop IPv6 fragments but still honor received ICMPv6 PTB error messages, an attacker could easily attack the corresponding peering session by simply sending an ICMPv6 PTB message with a reported MTU smaller than 1280 bytes. Once the attack packet has been sent, the aforementioned routers will themselves be the ones dropping their own traffic.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-10142", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nIetf\u00bbIpv6\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:ietf:ipv6:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.65% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 77 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.11%  0.65%  -0.46 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-17", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/17/cwe.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://kb.pulsesecure.net/articles/Pulse_Security_Advisories/SA43730", "ref_desc": "Pulse Security Advisory: SA43730 - 2018-04 Security Bulletin: Multiple vulnerabilities resolved in Pulse Connect Secure / Pulse Policy Secure 9.0R1 and vTM 18.1CVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/-gLA5WtlMQNy8eUDs849yuofZVY.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/95797", "ref_desc": "IETF IPv6 Protocol CVE-2016-10142 Denial of Service Vulnerability", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8021", "ref_desc": "RFC 8021 - Generation of IPv6 Atomic Fragments Considered HarmfulThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-6man-deprecate-atomfrag-generation-08", "ref_desc": "draft-ietf-6man-deprecate-atomfrag-generation-08 - Generation of IPv6 Atomic Fragments Considered HarmfulThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0817.html", "ref_desc": "RHSA-2017:0817 - Security Advisory - Red Hat Customer PortalCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/fm_lVRqfmY7sEo5B-wj977ivLFY.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K57211290?utm_source=f5support&amp;utm_medium=RSS", "ref_desc": "IPv6 fragmentation vulnerability CVE-2016-10142", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1038256", "ref_desc": "Juniper Junos ICMPv6 Fragment Processing Flaw Lets Remote Users Deny Service - SecurityTracker", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
