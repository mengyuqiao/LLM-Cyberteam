{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-4306", "Description": "Multiple information leaks exist in various IOCTL handlers of the Kaspersky Internet Security KLDISK driver. Specially crafted IOCTL requests can cause the driver to return out-of-bounds kernel memory, potentially leaking sensitive information such as privileged tokens or kernel memory addresses that may be useful in bypassing kernel mitigations. An unprivileged user can run a program from user-mode to trigger this vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-4306", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nKaspersky\u00bbTotal Security\u00bbVersion:16.0.0.614cpe:2.3:a:kaspersky:total_security:16.0.0.614:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 41 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.10%  +0.03 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.talosintelligence.com/reports/TALOS-2016-0168/", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2016-0168 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat IntelligenceExploit;Technical Description;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1036703", "ref_desc": "Kaspersky Internet Security Driver Bugs Let Local Users Obtain System Memory Contents and Deny Service - SecurityTrackerCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/NhSFrN_jc1lXDozu58nh49GppQQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1036702", "ref_desc": "Kaspersky Anti-Virus Driver Bugs Let Local Users Obtain System Memory Contents and Deny Service - SecurityTrackerCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/PMfMK0QLndMdJc8vzU-r22jLFeU.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://securitytracker.com/id/1036702", "ref_desc": "Kaspersky Anti-Virus Driver Bugs Let Local Users Obtain System Memory Contents and Deny Service - SecurityTrackerThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/tyzmz4MFCX3DRTUs1Ahioo3GcHk.html"}]}
