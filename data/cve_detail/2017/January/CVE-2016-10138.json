{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-10138", "Description": "An issue was discovered on BLU Advance 5.0 and BLU R1 HD devices with Shanghai Adups software. The com.adups.fota.sysoper app is installed as a system app and cannot be disabled by the user. In the com.adups.fota.sysoper app's AndroidManifest.xml file, it sets the android:sharedUserId attribute to a value of android.uid.system which makes it execute as the system user, which is a very privileged user on the device. The app has an exported broadcast receiver named com.adups.fota.sysoper.WriteCommandReceiver which any app on the device can interact with. Therefore, any app can send a command embedded in an intent which will be executed by the WriteCommandReceiver component which is executing as the system user. The third-party app, utilizing the WriteCommandReceiver, can perform the following actions: call a phone number, factory reset the device, take pictures of the screen, record the screen in a video, install applications, inject events, obtain the Android log, and others. In addition, the com.adups.fota.sysoper.TaskService component will make a request to a URL of http://rebootv5.adsunflower.com/ps/fetch.do where the commands in the String array with a key of sf in the JSON Object sent back by the server will be executed as the system user. Since the connection is made via HTTP, it is vulnerable to a MITM attack.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-10138", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAdups\u00bbAdups Fota\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:adups:adups_fota:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-310", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/310/cwe.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/96853", "ref_desc": "Adups Fota CVE-2016-10138 Information Disclosure Vulnerability", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/16/us/politics/china-phones-software-security.html", "ref_desc": "Secret Back Door in Some U.S. Phones Sent Data to China, Analysts Say - The New York TimesPress/Media CoverageCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/qoj33RENY6P_JOO-GJishRKvRQQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.kryptowire.com/adups_security_analysis.html", "ref_desc": "Page not found - KryptowireTechnical Description;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/x_FhrKDUaQdeTbdS2dnhsWj4ksk.html"}]}
