{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-10136", "Description": "An issue was discovered on BLU R1 HD devices with Shanghai Adups software. The content provider named com.adups.fota.sysoper.provider.InfoProvider in the app with a package name of com.adups.fota.sysoper allows any app on the device to read, write, and delete files as the system user. In the com.adups.fota.sysoper app's AndroidManifest.xml file, it sets the android:sharedUserId attribute to a value of android.uid.system which makes it execute as the system user, which is a very privileged user on the device. This allows a third-party app to read, write, and delete files owned by the system user. The third-party app can modify the /data/system/users/0/settings_secure.xml file to add an app as a notification listener to be able to receive the text of notifications as they are received on the device. This also allows the /data/system/users/0/accounts.db to be read which contains authentication tokens for various accounts on the device. The third-party app can obtain privileged information and also modify files to obtain more privileges on the device.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-10136", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nAdups\u00bbAdups Fota\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:adups:adups_fota:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.85 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-310", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/310/cwe.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/96854", "ref_desc": "Adups CVE-2016-10136 Local Information Disclosure Vulnerability", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/16/us/politics/china-phones-software-security.html", "ref_desc": "Secret Back Door in Some U.S. Phones Sent Data to China, Analysts Say - The New York TimesPress/Media CoverageCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/qoj33RENY6P_JOO-GJishRKvRQQ.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.kryptowire.com/adups_security_analysis.html", "ref_desc": "Page not found - KryptowireTechnical Description;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/x_FhrKDUaQdeTbdS2dnhsWj4ksk.html"}]}
