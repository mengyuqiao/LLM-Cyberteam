{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-9554", "Description": "The Sophos Web Appliance Remote / Secure Web Gateway server (version 4.2.1.3) is vulnerable to a Remote Command Injection vulnerability in its web administrative interface. These vulnerabilities occur in MgrDiagnosticTools.php (/controllers/MgrDiagnosticTools.php), in the component responsible for performing diagnostic tests with the UNIX wget utility. The application doesn't properly escape the information passed in the 'url' variable before calling the executeCommand class function ($this->dtObj->executeCommand). This function calls exec() with unsanitized user input allowing for remote command injection. The page that contains the vulnerabilities, /controllers/MgrDiagnosticTools.php, is accessed by a built-in command answered by the administrative interface. The command that calls to that vulnerable page (passed in the 'section' parameter) is: 'configuration'. Exploitation of this vulnerability yields shell access to the remote machine under the 'spiderman' user account.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-9554", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nSophos\u00bbWeb Appliance\u00bbVersion:4.2.1.3cpe:2.3:a:sophos:web_appliance:4.2.1.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "3.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 91 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  3.40%  3.04%  -0.37 \n 2  2024-06-06  2.71%  3.40%  +0.69 \n 3  2024-03-22  2.62%  2.71%  +0.09 \n 4  2023-03-26  2.78%  2.62%  -0.16 \n 5  2023-03-07  8.08%  2.78%  -5.30 ", "CVSS Scores": "9.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/77/Improper-Neutralization-of-Special-Elements-used-in-a-Comman.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/95858", "ref_desc": "Sophos Web Appliance CVE-2016-9554 Remote Command Injection VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://pastebin.com/UB8Ye6ZU", "ref_desc": "[Ruby] sophos_webapp_va_wget_POST_cmdi.rb - Pastebin.comExploit", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://community.sophos.com/products/web-appliance/b/blog/posts/release-of-swa-version-4-3-1", "ref_desc": "Release of SWA version 4.3.1 - Blog - Web Appliance - Sophos CommunityRelease NotesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/yrHr8GcKQXA3HkWPpZr_FDR9GOE.html"}]}
