{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-4291", "Description": "When opening a Hangul HShow Document (.hpt) and processing a structure within the document, Hancom Office 2014 will use a field from the structure in an operation that can cause the integer to overflow. This result is then used to allocate memory to copy file data in. Due to the lack of bounds checking on the integer, the allocated memory buffer can be made to be undersized at which point the reading of file data will write outside the bounds of the buffer. This can lead to code execution under the context of the application.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-4291", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nHancom\u00bbHancom Office 2014Versions  up to, including, (<=) 9.1.0.2176cpe:2.3:a:hancom:hancom_office_2014:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 57 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.15%  0.20%  +0.05 \n 2  2023-08-10  0.14%  0.15%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.10%  0.14%  -0.97 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/190/Integer-Overflow-or-Wraparound.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.talosintelligence.com/reports/TALOS-2016-0146/", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2016-0146 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat IntelligenceExploit;Technical Description;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/92325", "ref_desc": "Hancom Office 2014 VP Multiple Local Arbitrary Code Execution VulnerabilitiesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/pV5ZgwkxbeWLIn53Zs4p2Ox_yU8.html"}]}
