{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-9015", "Description": "Versions 1.17 and 1.18 of the Python urllib3 library suffer from a vulnerability that can cause them, in certain configurations, to not correctly validate TLS certificates. This places users of the library with those configurations at risk of man-in-the-middle and information leakage attacks. This vulnerability affects users using versions 1.17 and 1.18 of the urllib3 library, who are using the optional PyOpenSSL support for TLS instead of the regular standard library TLS backend, and who are using OpenSSL 1.1.0 via PyOpenSSL. This is an extremely uncommon configuration, so the security impact of this vulnerability is low.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-9015", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPython\u00bbUrllib3\u00bbVersion:1.17cpe:2.3:a:python:urllib3:1.17:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPython\u00bbUrllib3\u00bbVersion:1.18cpe:2.3:a:python:urllib3:1.18:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.05% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 23 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.05%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.6", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/295/Improper-Certificate-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/93941", "ref_desc": "Python urllib3 CVE-2016-9015 TLS Certificate Validation Security Bypass VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/10/27/6", "ref_desc": "oss-security - CVE-2016-9015: Python urllib3 1.17 and 1.18 certificate verification failureMailing List;Mitigation", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
