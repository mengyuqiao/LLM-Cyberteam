{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-4296", "Description": "When opening a Hangul Hcell Document (.cell) and processing a record that uses the CSSValFormat object, Hancom Office 2014 will search for an underscore (\"_\") character at the end of the string and write a null terminator after it. If the character is at the very end of the string, the application will mistakenly write the null-byte outside the bounds of its destination. This can result in heap corruption that can lead code execution under the context of the application", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-4296", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nHancom\u00bbHancom Office 2014Versions  up to, including, (<=) 9.1.0.2176cpe:2.3:a:hancom:hancom_office_2014:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.14% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.14%  +0.04 \n 2  2023-08-10  0.10%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.10%  0.10%  -1.01 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/92327", "ref_desc": "Hancom Office 2014 VP Multiple Local Arbitrary Code Execution VulnerabilitiesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/2Nyi8hQnMlSfBQ5eMVnU717_pZ4.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.talosintelligence.com/reports/TALOS-2016-0151/", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2016-0151 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat IntelligenceExploit;Technical Description;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
