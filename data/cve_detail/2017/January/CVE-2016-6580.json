{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-6580", "Description": "A HTTP/2 implementation built using any version of the Python priority library prior to version 1.2.0 could be targeted by a malicious peer by having that peer assign priority information for every possible HTTP/2 stream ID. The priority tree would happily continue to store the priority information for each stream, and would therefore allocate unbounded amounts of memory. Attempting to actually use a tree like this would also cause extremely high CPU usage to maintain the tree.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-6580", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nPython\u00bbPython Priority Library\u00bbVersion:1.0.0cpe:2.3:a:python:python_priority_library:1.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPython\u00bbPython Priority Library\u00bbVersion:1.1.0cpe:2.3:a:python:python_priority_library:1.1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPython\u00bbPython Priority Library\u00bbVersion:1.1.1cpe:2.3:a:python:python_priority_library:1.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 37 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.08%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-399", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/399/cwe.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://python-hyper.org/priority/en/latest/security/CVE-2016-6580.html", "ref_desc": "DoS via Unlimited Stream Insertion \u2014 priority 1.3.0 documentationMitigation;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/92311", "ref_desc": "Python priority CVE-2016-6580 Remote Denial of Service VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
