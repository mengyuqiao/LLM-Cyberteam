{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-9885", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Pivotal GemFire for PCF 1.6.x versions prior to 1.6.5 and 1.7.x versions prior to 1.7.1. The gfsh (Geode Shell) endpoint, used by operators and application developers to connect to their cluster, is unauthenticated and publicly accessible. Because HTTPS communications are terminated at the gorouter, communications from the gorouter to GemFire clusters are unencrypted. An attacker could run any command available on gfsh and could cause denial of service, lost confidentiality of data, escalate privileges, or eavesdrop on other communications between the gorouter and the cluster.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-9885", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service;Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nPivotal Software\u00bbGemfire For Pivotal Cloud Foundry\u00bbVersion:1.7.0.0cpe:2.3:a:pivotal_software:gemfire_for_pivotal_cloud_foundry:1.7.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPivotal Software\u00bbGemfire For Pivotal Cloud Foundry\u00bbVersion:1.6.4.0cpe:2.3:a:pivotal_software:gemfire_for_pivotal_cloud_foundry:1.6.4.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPivotal Software\u00bbGemfire For Pivotal Cloud Foundry\u00bbVersion:1.6.3.0cpe:2.3:a:pivotal_software:gemfire_for_pivotal_cloud_foundry:1.6.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPivotal Software\u00bbGemfire For Pivotal Cloud Foundry\u00bbVersion:1.6.2cpe:2.3:a:pivotal_software:gemfire_for_pivotal_cloud_foundry:1.6.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPivotal Software\u00bbGemfire For Pivotal Cloud Foundry\u00bbVersion:1.6.1cpe:2.3:a:pivotal_software:gemfire_for_pivotal_cloud_foundry:1.6.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPivotal Software\u00bbGemfire For Pivotal Cloud Foundry\u00bbVersion:1.6.0.0cpe:2.3:a:pivotal_software:gemfire_for_pivotal_cloud_foundry:1.6.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.24% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 61 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.24%  -0.64 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}, {"CWE_ID": "CWE-254", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/254/cwe.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2016-9885", "ref_desc": "CVE-2016-9885 gfsh exposed over go router for GemFire for PCF | Security | PivotalVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/95270", "ref_desc": "Pivotal GemFire for PCF CVE-2016-9885 Remote Privilege Escalation Vulnerability", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
