{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-6908", "Description": "Characters from languages are such as Arabic, Hebrew are displayed from RTL (Right To Left) order in Opera 37.0.2192.105088 for Android, due to mishandling of several unicode characters such as U+FE70, U+0622, U+0623 etc and how they are rendered combined with (first strong character) such as an IP address or alphabet could lead to a spoofed URL. It was noticed that by placing neutral characters such as \"/\", \"?\" in filepath causes the URL to be flipped and displayed from Right To Left. However, in order for the URL to be spoofed the URL must begin with an IP address followed by neutral characters as omnibox considers IP address to be combination of punctuation and numbers and since LTR (Left To Right) direction is not properly enforced, this causes the entire URL to be treated and rendered from RTL (Right To Left). However, it doesn't have be an IP address, what matters is that first strong character (generally, alphabetic character) in the URL must be an RTL character.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-6908", "Vulnerability Categories": "Open redirect", "Affected Products": "\nOpera\u00bbOpera Browser\u00bbVersion:37.0.2192.105088ForAndroidcpe:2.3:a:opera:opera_browser:37.0.2192.105088:*:*:*:*:android:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.06% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 30 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.06%  -0.01 \n 2  2024-11-18  0.07%  0.07%  0.00 \n 3  2023-11-17  0.07%  0.07%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/601/URL-Redirection-to-Untrusted-Site-Open-Redirect-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/92701", "ref_desc": "Opera Web Browser for Android CVE-2016-6908 Unspecified Address Bar Spoofing VulnerabilityVDB Entry;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
