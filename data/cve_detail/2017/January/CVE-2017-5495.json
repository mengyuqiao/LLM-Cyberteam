{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-5495", "Description": "All versions of Quagga, 0.93 through 1.1.0, are vulnerable to an unbounded memory allocation in the telnet 'vty' CLI, leading to a Denial-of-Service of Quagga daemons, or even the entire host. When Quagga daemons are configured with their telnet CLI enabled, anyone who can connect to the TCP ports can trigger this vulnerability, prior to authentication. Most distributions restrict the Quagga telnet interface to local access only by default. The Quagga telnet interface 'vty' input buffer grows automatically, without bound, so long as a newline is not entered. This allows an attacker to cause the Quagga daemon to allocate unbounded memory by sending very long strings without a newline. Eventually the daemon is terminated by the system, or the system itself runs out of memory. This is fixed in Quagga 1.1.1 and Free Range Routing (FRR) Protocol Suite 2017-01-10.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5495", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nQuagga\u00bbQuaggaVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.1.0cpe:2.3:a:quagga:quagga:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "20.83% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 96 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-08-08  26.80%  20.83%  -5.97 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.11%  26.80%  +25.70 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0794.html", "ref_desc": "RHSA-2017:0794 - Security Advisory - Red Hat Customer PortalCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/9YjratTXmecr5qX_1KWJa43t4Zk.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://savannah.nongnu.org/forum/forum.php?forum_id=8783", "ref_desc": "Quagga Routing Software - News: Quagga 1.1.1 Released [Savannah]Release Notes;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/freerangerouting/frr/pull/63", "ref_desc": "lib: limit size of vty buffer to 4096 bytes by qlyoung \u00b7 Pull Request #63 \u00b7 FRRouting/frr \u00b7 GitHubPatch;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1037688", "ref_desc": "Quagga vty_write() Buffer Memory Allocation Flaw Lets Remote Users Cause the Target Service to Crash - SecurityTracker", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/95745", "ref_desc": "Quagga CVE-2017-5495 Denial of Service Vulnerability", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://lists.quagga.net/pipermail/quagga-dev/2017-January/016586.html", "ref_desc": "[quagga-dev 16560] CVE-2017-5495 text", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
