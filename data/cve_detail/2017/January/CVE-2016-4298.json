{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-4298", "Description": "When opening a Hangul HShow Document (.hpt) and processing a structure within the document, Hancom Office 2014 will attempt to allocate space for a list of elements using a length from the file. When calculating this length, an integer overflow can be made to occur which will cause the buffer to be undersized when the application tries to copy file data into the object containing this structure. This allows one to overwrite contiguous data in the heap which can lead to code-execution under the context of the application.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-4298", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nHancom\u00bbHancom Office 2014Versions  up to, including, (<=) 9.1.0.2176cpe:2.3:a:hancom:hancom_office_2014:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 56 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.16%  0.19%  +0.03 \n 2  2023-08-10  0.16%  0.16%  0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  1.10%  0.16%  -0.94 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/190/Integer-Overflow-or-Wraparound.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/92325", "ref_desc": "Hancom Office 2014 VP Multiple Local Arbitrary Code Execution VulnerabilitiesCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/pV5ZgwkxbeWLIn53Zs4p2Ox_yU8.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.talosintelligence.com/reports/TALOS-2016-0144/", "ref_desc": "TALOS-2016-0144 || Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat IntelligenceExploit;Technical Description;Third Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
