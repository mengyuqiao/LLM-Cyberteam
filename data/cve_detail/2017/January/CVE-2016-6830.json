{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-6830", "Description": "The \"process-execute\" and \"process-spawn\" procedures in CHICKEN Scheme used fixed-size buffers for holding the arguments and environment variables to use in its execve() call. This would allow user-supplied argument/environment variable lists to trigger a buffer overrun. This affects all releases of CHICKEN up to and including 4.11 (it will be fixed in 4.12 and 5.0, which are not yet released).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-6830", "Vulnerability Categories": "Overflow", "Affected Products": "\nCall-cc\u00bbChickenVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.11.0cpe:2.3:a:call-cc:chicken:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.22%  0.21%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.22%  -0.67 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/119/Improper-Restriction-of-Operations-within-the-Bounds-of-a-Me.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/92550", "ref_desc": "CHICKEN Buffer Overflow and Information Disclosure VulnerabilitiesThird Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/W0p32FoqaYynonAV9wS3cM02GV4.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/chicken-announce/2016-08/msg00001.html", "ref_desc": "[Chicken-announce] [SECURITY] Buffer overrun in process-execute and procPatch;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/xvz8SNM1FW_9GIfKwezEEt6KtDs.html"}]}
