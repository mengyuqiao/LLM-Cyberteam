{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-6595", "Description": "The SwarmKit toolkit 1.12.0 for Docker allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (prevention of cluster joins) via a long sequence of join and quit actions.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue, stating that this sequence is not \"removing the state that is left by old nodes. At some point the manager obviously stops being able to accept new nodes, since it runs out of memory. Given that both for Docker swarm and for Docker Swarmkit nodes are *required* to provide a secret token (it's actually the only mode of operation), this means that no adversary can simply join nodes and exhaust manager resources. We can't do anything about a manager running out of memory and not being able to add new legitimate nodes to the system. This is merely a resource provisioning issue, and definitely not a CVE worthy vulnerability.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-6595", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nDocker\u00bbDocker\u00bbVersion:1.12.0cpe:2.3:a:docker:docker:1.12.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.62% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 79 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.48%  0.62%  +0.14 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.13%  0.48%  -0.65 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-399", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/399/cwe.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/09/02/8", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Re: Re: cve request: docker swarmkit Dos occurs by repeatly joining and quitting swam cluster as a nodeThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/09/02/1", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Re: cve request: docker swarmkit Dos occurs by repeatly joining and quitting swam cluster as a nodeThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1036548", "ref_desc": "Docker Unspecified Flaw Lets Remote Authenticated Users Deny Service on the Target Swarm Cluster - SecurityTracker", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/08/04/1", "ref_desc": "oss-security - Re: cve request: docker swarmkit Dos occurs by repeatly joining and quitting swam cluster as a nodeThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/92195", "ref_desc": "Docker Swarmkit Local Denial of Service Vulnerability", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
