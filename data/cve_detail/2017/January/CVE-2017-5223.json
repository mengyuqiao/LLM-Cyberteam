{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-5223", "Description": "An issue was discovered in PHPMailer before 5.2.22. PHPMailer's msgHTML method applies transformations to an HTML document to make it usable as an email message body. One of the transformations is to convert relative image URLs into attachments using a script-provided base directory. If no base directory is provided, it resolves to /, meaning that relative image URLs get treated as absolute local file paths and added as attachments. To form a remote vulnerability, the msgHTML method must be called, passed an unfiltered, user-supplied HTML document, and must not set a base directory.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5223", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nPhpmailer Project\u00bbPhpmailerVersions  up to, including, (<=) 5.2.21cpe:2.3:a:phpmailer_project:phpmailer:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "74.95% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 98 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  91.37%  74.95%  -16.42 \n 2  2024-12-10  92.33%  91.37%  -0.96 \n 3  2024-09-03  93.43%  92.33%  -1.10 \n 4  2024-08-12  95.09%  93.43%  -1.66 \n 5  2023-03-07  2.04%  95.09%  +93.05 ", "CVSS Scores": "2.1", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/blob/master/SECURITY.md", "ref_desc": "PHPMailer/SECURITY.md at master \u00b7 PHPMailer/PHPMailer \u00b7 GitHubIssue Tracking;Patch;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/8NKAcn-nAy3IKl43UtkuNGUoERI.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/95328", "ref_desc": "PHPMailer CVE-2017-5223 Local Information Disclosure VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://kalilinux.co/2017/01/12/phpmailer-cve-2017-5223-local-information-disclosure-vulnerability-analysis/", "ref_desc": "Cleus - Made For GeeksExploit;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/43056/", "ref_desc": "PHPMailer < 5.2.21 - Local File Disclosure", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
