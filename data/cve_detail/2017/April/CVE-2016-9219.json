{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-9219", "Description": "A vulnerability with IPv6 UDP ingress packet processing in Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an unexpected reload of the device. The vulnerability is due to incomplete IPv6 UDP header validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IPv6 UDP packet to a specific port on the targeted device. An exploit could allow the attacker to impact the availability of the device as it could unexpectedly reload. This vulnerability affects Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) running software version 8.2.121.0 or 8.3.102.0.
