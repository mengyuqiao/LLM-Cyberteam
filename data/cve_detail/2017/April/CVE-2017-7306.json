{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-7306", "Description": "Riverbed RiOS through 9.6.0 has a weak default password for the secure vault, which makes it easier for physically proximate attackers to defeat the secure-vault protection mechanism by leveraging knowledge of the password algorithm and the appliance serial number. NOTE: the vendor believes that this does not meet the definition of a vulnerability. The product contains correct computational logic for supporting arbitrary password changes by customers; however, a password change is optional to meet different customers' needs", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-7306", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nRiverbed\u00bbRiosVersions  up to, including, (<=) 9.6.0cpe:2.3:o:riverbed:rios:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.12% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 47 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.09%  0.12%  +0.03 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.09%  -0.80 ", "CVSS Scores": "1.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-521 Weak Password Requirements", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/521/Weak-Password-Requirements.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://supportkb.riverbed.com/support/index?page=content&id=S30065", "ref_desc": "Riverbed Support: S30065 - Riverbed Security Advisory for CVE-2017-5670, CVE-2017-7305, CVE-2017-7306, and CVE-2017-7307Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/KuGdt9tUoes71oIn13NLR0oLHn4.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Feb/25", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: CVE-2017-5670 : Riverbed RiOS insecure cryptographic storageExploit;Technical Description;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/mGuNzH03qDnGzzMy-uPix--ih_w.html"}]}
