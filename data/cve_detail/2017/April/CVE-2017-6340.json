Additionally, IWSVA implements incorrect access control that allows any authenticated, remote user (even with low privileges like 'Auditor') to create or modify reports, and consequently take advantage of this XSS vulnerability. The JavaScript is executed when victims visit reports or auditlog pages.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-6340", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nTrendmicro\u00bbInterscan Web Security Virtual ApplianceVersions  up to, including, (<=) 6.5cpe:2.3:a:trendmicro:interscan_web_security_virtual_appliance:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.09% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 39 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.10%  0.09%  -0.01 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.10%  -0.97 ", "CVSS Scores": "3.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/97487", "ref_desc": "Trend Micro InterScan Web Security Virtual Appliance CVE-2017-6340 HTML Injection VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.qualys.com/2017/01/12/qsa-2017-01-12/qsa-2017-01-12.pdf", "ref_desc": "Exploit;Technical Description;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/c9dn4sleMp7Wu9WwFtfYX6BZOk8.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://success.trendmicro.com/solution/1116960", "ref_desc": "Multiple Vulnerabilities - InterScan Web Security Virtual Appliance 6.5Patch;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/HPgUZ4UzulqwK4novpFUMWD_1-A.html"}]}
