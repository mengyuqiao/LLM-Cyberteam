{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-5661", "Description": "In Apache FOP before 2.2, files lying on the filesystem of the server which uses FOP can be revealed to arbitrary users who send maliciously formed SVG files. The file types that can be shown depend on the user context in which the exploitable application is running. If the user is root a full compromise of the server - including confidential or sensitive files - would be possible. XXE can also be used to attack the availability of the server via denial of service as the references within a xml document can trivially trigger an amplification attack.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5661", "Vulnerability Categories": "XML external entity (XXE) injection;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbFormatting Objects ProcessorVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.1cpe:2.3:a:apache:formatting_objects_processor:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.32% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 67 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  1.16%  0.32%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-611 Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/611/Improper-Restriction-of-XML-External-Entity-Reference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2021-14", "ref_desc": "[R1] Tenable.sc 5.19.0 Fixes Multiple Third-party Vulnerabilities - Security Advisory | Tenable\u00aeCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/0Z13RKTTuKSKcHPG1TYclfWfiR4.html"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/97947", "ref_desc": "Apache FOP CVE-2017-5661 XML External Entity Information Disclosure Vulnerability", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3864", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-3864-1 fop", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/security.html", "ref_desc": "The Apache&trade; XML Graphics Project - CommunityPatch;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/SF37jDiXyKuu4OzEEIJwkWjkD8I.html"}]}
