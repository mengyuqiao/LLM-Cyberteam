{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-8056", "Description": "WatchGuard Fireware v11.12.1 and earlier mishandles requests referring to an XML External Entity (XXE), in the XML-RPC agent. This causes the Firebox wgagent process to crash. This process crash ends all authenticated sessions to the Firebox, including management connections, and prevents new authenticated sessions until the process has recovered. The Firebox may also experience an overall degradation in performance while the wgagent process recovers. An attacker could continuously send XML-RPC requests that contain references to external entities to perform a limited Denial of Service (DoS) attack against an affected Firebox.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-8056", "Vulnerability Categories": "XML external entity (XXE) injection;Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nWatchguard\u00bbFirewareVersions  up to, including, (<=) 11.2.1cpe:2.3:o:watchguard:fireware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 57 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.27%  0.19%  -0.08 \n 2  2024-09-17  0.46%  0.27%  -0.19 \n 3  2024-04-25  0.40%  0.46%  +0.06 \n 4  2024-03-15  0.31%  0.40%  +0.09 \n 5  2024-02-09  0.27%  0.31%  +0.04 \n 6  2023-05-08  0.35%  0.27%  -0.08 \n 7  2023-03-07  1.02%  0.35%  -0.67 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-611 Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/611/Improper-Restriction-of-XML-External-Entity-Reference.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://watchguardsupport.force.com/publicKB?type=KBSecurityIssues&SFDCID=kA62A0000000KlBSAU", "ref_desc": "WatchGuard Support CenterVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.sidertia.com/Home/Community/Blog/2017/04/17/Fixed-the-Fireware-Vulnerabilities-discovered-by-Sidertia", "ref_desc": "Fixed the Fireware Vulnerabilities discovered by SidertiaExploit;Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/nMYX56yxYOmK2X59gibIXA8tAgg.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/142177/watchguardfbxtm-xxeinject.txt", "ref_desc": "Watchguard Firebox / XTM XXE Injection \u2248 Packet StormExploit;Third Party Advisory;VDB EntryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/nohhrQcmwEa21B80d1NdsTXgFeA.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://www.watchguard.com/support/release-notes/fireware/11/en-US/EN_ReleaseNotes_Fireware_11_12_2/index.html", "ref_desc": "Fireware Release NotesRelease Notes;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/yzCUz03Kl5-uYpmnDoEqEVuDQAM.html"}]}
