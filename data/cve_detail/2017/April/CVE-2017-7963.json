{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-7963", "Description": "The GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP) interfaces for PHP through 7.1.4 allow attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption and application crash) via operations on long strings. NOTE: the vendor disputes this, stating \"There is no security issue here, because GMP safely aborts in case of an OOM condition. The only attack vector here is denial of service. However, if you allow attacker-controlled, unbounded allocations you have a DoS vector regardless of GMP's OOM behavior.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-7963", "Vulnerability Categories": "Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nPHP\u00bbPHPVersions  up to, including, (<=) 7.1.4cpe:2.3:a:php:php:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 42 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-09-17  0.08%  0.10%  +0.02 \n 2  2024-04-25  0.07%  0.08%  +0.00 \n 3  2024-03-15  0.07%  0.07%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-02-09  0.10%  0.07%  -0.03 \n 5  2023-12-31  0.09%  0.10%  +0.01 \n 6  2023-05-08  0.06%  0.09%  +0.03 \n 7  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.06%  -0.82 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/770/Allocation-of-Resources-Without-Limits-or-Throttling.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=74308", "ref_desc": "PHP :: Bug #74308 :: Memory corruption in gmp_powmIssue Tracking;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
