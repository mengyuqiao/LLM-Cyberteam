{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-7892", "Description": "Sandstorm Cap'n Proto before 0.5.3.1 allows remote crashes related to a compiler optimization. A remote attacker can trigger a segfault in a 32-bit libcapnp application because Cap'n Proto relies on pointer arithmetic calculations that overflow. An example compiler with optimization that elides a bounds check in such calculations is Apple LLVM version 8.1.0 (clang-802.0.41). The attack vector is a crafted far pointer within a message.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-7892", "Vulnerability Categories": "Input validation", "Affected Products": "\nCapnproto\u00bbCapnprotoVersions  up to, including, (<=) 0.5.3cpe:2.3:a:capnproto:capnproto:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.19% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 57 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.25%  0.19%  -0.05 \n 2  2024-09-17  0.20%  0.25%  +0.05 \n 3  2024-04-25  0.18%  0.20%  +0.02 \n 4  2024-03-15  0.16%  0.18%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-02-09  0.25%  0.16%  -0.08 \n 6  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.25%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/20/Improper-Input-Validation.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://github.com/sandstorm-io/capnproto/blob/master/security-advisories/2017-04-17-0-apple-clang-elides-bounds-check.md", "ref_desc": "capnproto/2017-04-17-0-apple-clang-elides-bounds-check.md at master \u00b7 capnproto/capnproto \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
