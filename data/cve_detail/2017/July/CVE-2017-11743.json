An attacker with knowledge of the hard-coded credential and the ability to communicate directly with the Mirth Connect management console may be able to intercept sensitive patient information. The admin account password is hard-coded as $K8t1ng throughout the application, and is the same across all installations. Customers do not have the option to change the Mirth Connect admin account password. The Mirth Connect admin account is created during the Connex install. The plaintext account password is hard-coded multiple times in the Connex install and update scripts.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-11743", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMedhost\u00bbConnex\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:medhost:connex:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.20% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 57 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.19%  0.20%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-05-16  0.19%  0.19%  0.00 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.19%  -0.69 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/798/Use-of-Hard-coded-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Jul/75", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: CVE-2017-11743 MEDHOST Connex contains hard-coded Mirth Connect admin passwordMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/100086", "ref_desc": "MEDHOST Connex CVE-2017-11743 Hardcoded Password Security Bypass VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
