{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-10396", "Description": "The racoon daemon in IPsec-Tools 0.8.2 contains a remotely exploitable computational-complexity attack when parsing and storing ISAKMP fragments. The implementation permits a remote attacker to exhaust computational resources on the remote endpoint by repeatedly sending ISAKMP fragment packets in a particular order such that the worst-case computational complexity is realized in the algorithm utilized to determine if reassembly of the fragments can take place.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-10396", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nIpsec-tools\u00bbIpsec-tools\u00bbVersion:0.8.2cpe:2.3:a:ipsec-tools:ipsec-tools:0.8.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.45% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 75 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.44%  0.45%  +0.01 \n 2  2024-09-17  0.26%  0.44%  +0.18 \n 3  2024-05-24  0.22%  0.26%  +0.04 \n 4  2024-05-10  0.18%  0.22%  +0.03 \n 5  2024-04-25  0.17%  0.18%  +0.01 \n 6  2024-03-15  0.16%  0.17%  +0.02 \n 7  2024-02-09  0.44%  0.16%  -0.29 \n 8  2023-03-07  1.14%  0.44%  -0.70 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-407 Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/407/Inefficient-Algorithmic-Complexity.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/src/crypto/dist/ipsec-tools/src/racoon/isakmp_frag.c.diff?r1=1.5&r2=1.5.36.1", "ref_desc": "Mailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/src/crypto/dist/ipsec-tools/src/racoon/isakmp_frag.c?only_with_tag=MAIN", "ref_desc": "CVS log for src/crypto/dist/ipsec-tools/src/racoon/isakmp_frag.cThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://gnats.netbsd.org/cgi-bin/query-pr-single.pl?number=51682", "ref_desc": "NetBSD Problem Report #51682: Remote un-authenticated denial of serviceMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
