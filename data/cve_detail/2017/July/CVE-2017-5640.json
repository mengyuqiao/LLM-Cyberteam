{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-5640", "Description": "It was noticed that a malicious process impersonating an Impala daemon in Apache Impala (incubating) 2.7.0 to 2.8.0 could cause Impala daemons to skip authentication checks when Kerberos is enabled (but TLS is not). If the malicious server responds with 'COMPLETE' before the SASL handshake has completed, the client will consider the handshake as completed even though no exchange of credentials has happened.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5640", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbImpala\u00bbVersion:2.8.0cpe:2.3:a:apache:impala:2.8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nApache\u00bbImpala\u00bbVersion:2.7.0cpe:2.3:a:apache:impala:2.7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.22% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 59 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.15%  0.22%  +0.07 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.15%  -0.74 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/c02e83aa46c90b7cbc87dd649cf8f9b73e11053eddea9144a397da53@%3Cdev.impala.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "Pony Mail!Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/99508", "ref_desc": "Apache IMPALA CVE-2017-5640 Authentication Bypass VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
