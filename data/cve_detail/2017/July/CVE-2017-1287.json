{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-1287", "Description": "IBM Rhapsody DM 5.0 and 6.0 could allow a remote attacker to conduct phishing attacks, using an open redirect attack. By persuading a victim to visit a specially-crafted Web site, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to spoof the URL displayed to redirect a user to a malicious Web site that would appear to be trusted. This could allow the attacker to obtain highly sensitive information or conduct further attacks against the victim.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-1287", "Vulnerability Categories": "Open redirect", "Affected Products": "\nIBM\u00bbRhapsody Design Manager\u00bbVersion:5.0.2cpe:2.3:a:ibm:rhapsody_design_manager:5.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nIBM\u00bbRhapsody Design Manager\u00bbVersion:5.0cpe:2.3:a:ibm:rhapsody_design_manager:5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nIBM\u00bbRhapsody Design Manager\u00bbVersion:6.0.1cpe:2.3:a:ibm:rhapsody_design_manager:6.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nIBM\u00bbRhapsody Design Manager\u00bbVersion:6.0cpe:2.3:a:ibm:rhapsody_design_manager:6.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nIBM\u00bbRhapsody Design Manager\u00bbVersion:6.0.3cpe:2.3:a:ibm:rhapsody_design_manager:6.0.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nIBM\u00bbRhapsody Design Manager\u00bbVersion:6.0.2cpe:2.3:a:ibm:rhapsody_design_manager:6.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nIBM\u00bbRhapsody Design Manager\u00bbVersion:5.0.1cpe:2.3:a:ibm:rhapsody_design_manager:5.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 27 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-06-03  0.07%  0.07%  0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.06%  0.07%  -0.99 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/601/URL-Redirection-to-Untrusted-Site-Open-Redirect-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22006052", "ref_desc": "IBM Security Bulletin: Cross-site Scripting vulnerabilities affect IBM Rational products based on IBM Jazz technologyPatch;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/2uSZm8kHXtcnyaHNygUm69hCkAI.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/125148", "ref_desc": "IBM Rhapsody DM HTTP open redirect CVE-2017-1287 Vulnerability ReportVDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
