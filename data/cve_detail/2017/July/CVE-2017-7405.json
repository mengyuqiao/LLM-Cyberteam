{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-7405", "Description": "On the D-Link DIR-615 before v20.12PTb04, once authenticated, this device identifies the user based on the IP address of his machine. By spoofing the IP address belonging to the victim's host, an attacker might be able to take over the administrative session without being prompted for authentication credentials. An attacker can get the victim's and router's IP addresses by simply sniffing the network traffic. Moreover, if the victim has web access enabled on his router and is accessing the web interface from a different network that is behind the NAT/Proxy, an attacker can sniff the network traffic to know the public IP address of the victim's router and take over his session as he won't be prompted for credentials.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-7405", "Vulnerability Categories": "Bypass;Gain privilege", "Affected Products": "\nDlink\u00bbDir-615Versions  up to, including, (<=) 20.12ptb01cpe:2.3:o:dlink:dir-615:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Dlink\u00bbDir-615", "EPSS Score": "0.25% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 64 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.23%  0.25%  +0.03 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.23%  -0.66 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-287 Improper Authentication", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/287/Improper-Authentication.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.qualys.com/2017/03/12/qsa-2017-03-12/qsa-2017-03-12.pdf", "ref_desc": "Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/KOoIalc6P_GYrSmyUb-bgJJrjGA.html"}, {"ref_link": "ftp://ftp2.dlink.com/SECURITY_ADVISEMENTS/DIR-615/REVT/DIR-615_REVT_FIRMWARE_PATCH_v20.12PTb04.zip", "ref_desc": "Patch;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/vf066kKna26LvjrhETtv0DajUcY.html"}]}
