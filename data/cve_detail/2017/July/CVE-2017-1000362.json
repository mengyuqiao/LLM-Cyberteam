{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-1000362", "Description": "The re-key admin monitor was introduced in Jenkins 1.498 and re-encrypted all secrets in JENKINS_HOME with a new key. It also created a backup directory with all old secrets, and the key used to encrypt them. These backups were world-readable and not removed afterwards. Jenkins now deletes the backup directory, if present. Upgrading from before 1.498 will no longer create a backup directory. Administrators relying on file access permissions in their manually created backups are advised to check them for the directory $JENKINS_HOME/jenkins.security.RekeySecretAdminMonitor/backups, and delete it if present.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-1000362", "Vulnerability Categories": "Information leak", "Affected Products": "\nJenkins\u00bbJenkinsVersions  up to, including, (<=) 1.498cpe:2.3:a:jenkins:jenkins:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.25% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 64 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-03-25  0.22%  0.25%  +0.02 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.22%  -0.66 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/200/Exposure-of-Sensitive-Information-to-an-Unauthorized-Actor.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2017-02-01/", "ref_desc": "Jenkins Security Advisory 2017-02-01Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/1TopdcS-omkNs8qGgCeoQlHUnT4.html"}]}
