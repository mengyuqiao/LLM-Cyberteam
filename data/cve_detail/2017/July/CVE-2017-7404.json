{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-7404", "Description": "On the D-Link DIR-615 before v20.12PTb04, if a victim logged in to the Router's Web Interface visits a malicious site from another Browser tab, the malicious site then can send requests to the victim's Router without knowing the credentials (CSRF). An attacker can host a page that sends a POST request to Form2File.htm that tries to upload Firmware to victim's Router. This causes the router to reboot/crash resulting in Denial of Service. An attacker may succeed in uploading malicious Firmware.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-7404", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF);Denial of service", "Affected Products": "\nDlink\u00bbDir-615Versions  up to, including, (<=) 20.12ptb01cpe:2.3:o:dlink:dir-615:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versionsWhen used together with:Dlink\u00bbDir-615\u00bbVersion:N/A", "EPSS Score": "0.10% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 43 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.10%  +0.03 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://www.qualys.com/2017/03/12/qsa-2017-03-12/qsa-2017-03-12.pdf", "ref_desc": "Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/KOoIalc6P_GYrSmyUb-bgJJrjGA.html"}, {"ref_link": "ftp://ftp2.dlink.com/SECURITY_ADVISEMENTS/DIR-615/REVT/DIR-615_REVT_FIRMWARE_PATCH_v20.12PTb04.zip", "ref_desc": "Patch;Vendor AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/vf066kKna26LvjrhETtv0DajUcY.html"}]}
