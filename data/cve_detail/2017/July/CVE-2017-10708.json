{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-10708", "Description": "An issue was discovered in Apport through 2.20.x. In apport/report.py, Apport sets the ExecutablePath field and it then uses the path to run package specific hooks without protecting against path traversal. This allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted .crash file.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-10708", "Vulnerability Categories": "Directory traversal;Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nApport Project\u00bbApportVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.20.6cpe:2.3:a:apport_project:apport:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.56% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 77 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-02-19  0.46%  0.56%  +0.10 \n 2  2024-01-12  0.54%  0.46%  -0.08 \n 3  2023-12-03  0.55%  0.54%  -0.01 \n 4  2023-10-22  0.37%  0.55%  +0.18 \n 5  2023-08-03  0.31%  0.37%  +0.06 \n 6  2023-06-28  0.26%  0.31%  +0.05 \n 7  2023-05-28  0.21%  0.26%  +0.05 \n 8  2023-03-07  1.77%  0.21%  -1.55 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/22/Improper-Limitation-of-a-Pathname-to-a-Restricted-Directory-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apport/+changelog", "ref_desc": "Change log : apport package : UbuntuThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://launchpad.net/bugs/1700573", "ref_desc": "Bug #1700573 \u201cCode execution through path traversal in .crash fi...\u201d : Bugs : ApportThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
