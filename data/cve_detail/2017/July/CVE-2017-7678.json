{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-7678", "Description": "In Apache Spark before 2.2.0, it is possible for an attacker to take advantage of a user's trust in the server to trick them into visiting a link that points to a shared Spark cluster and submits data including MHTML to the Spark master, or history server. This data, which could contain a script, would then be reflected back to the user and could be evaluated and executed by MS Windows-based clients. It is not an attack on Spark itself, but on the user, who may then execute the script inadvertently when viewing elements of the Spark web UIs.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-7678", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross site scripting (XSS)", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbSparkVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.1.1cpe:2.3:a:apache:spark:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.07% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 33 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.07%  0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.07%  -0.81 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.3", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/79/Improper-Neutralization-of-Input-During-Web-Page-Generation-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/99603", "ref_desc": "Apache Spark CVE-2017-7678 Cross Site Scripting VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://apache-spark-developers-list.1001551.n3.nabble.com/CVE-2017-7678-Apache-Spark-XSS-web-UI-MHTML-vulnerability-td21947.html", "ref_desc": "Apache Spark Developers List - CVE-2017-7678 Apache Spark XSS web UI MHTML vulnerabilityVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
