{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-2295", "Description": "Versions of Puppet prior to 4.10.1 will deserialize data off the wire (from the agent to the server, in this case) with a attacker-specified format. This could be used to force YAML deserialization in an unsafe manner, which would lead to remote code execution. This change constrains the format of data on the wire to PSON or safely decoded YAML.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-2295", "Vulnerability Categories": "Execute code", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbDebian Linux\u00bbVersion:8.0cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nPuppet\u00bbPuppetVersions  up to, including, (<=) 4.10.0cpe:2.3:a:puppet:puppet:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.21% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 58 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.24%  0.21%  -0.04 \n 2  2023-08-31  0.29%  0.24%  -0.04 \n 3  2023-05-15  0.28%  0.29%  +0.01 \n 4  2023-03-07  4.70%  0.28%  -4.42 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/502/Deserialization-of-Untrusted-Data.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/98582", "ref_desc": "Multiple Puppet Products YAML Deserialization CVE-2017-2295 Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://puppet.com/security/cve/cve-2017-2295", "ref_desc": "CVE-2017-2295 - Puppet Server Remote Code Execution Via YAML Deserialization | PuppetVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3862", "ref_desc": "Debian -- Security Information -- DSA-3862-1 puppetThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
