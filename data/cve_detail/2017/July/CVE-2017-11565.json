{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-11565", "Description": "debian/tor.init in the Debian tor_0.2.9.11-1~deb9u1 package for Tor was designed to execute aa-exec from the standard system pathname if the apparmor package is installed, but implements this incorrectly (with a wrong assumption that the specific pathname would remain the same forever), which allows attackers to bypass intended AppArmor restrictions by leveraging the silent loss of this protection mechanism. NOTE: this does not affect systems, such as default Debian stretch installations, on which Tor startup relies on a systemd unit file (instead of this tor.init script).", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-11565", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nDebian\u00bbTOR\u00bbVersion:0.2.9.11-1cpe:2.3:a:debian:tor:0.2.9.11-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.08% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 36 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.07%  0.08%  +0.01 \n 2  2023-10-27  0.10%  0.07%  -0.03 \n 3  2023-06-02  0.10%  0.10%  +0.00 \n 4  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.10%  -0.79 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/99933", "ref_desc": "Debian CVE-2017-11565 Security Bypass VulnerabilityThird Party Advisory;VDB Entry", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://bugs.debian.org/869153", "ref_desc": "#869153 - tor: CVE-2017-11565: aa-exec is not longer in /usr/sbin and now apparmor is silently scraped - Debian Bug report logsIssue Tracking;Mailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
