{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-11171", "Description": "Bad reference counting in the context of accept_ice_connection() in gsm-xsmp-server.c in old versions of gnome-session up until version 2.29.92 allows a local attacker to establish ICE connections to gnome-session with invalid authentication data (an invalid magic cookie). Each failed authentication attempt will leak a file descriptor in gnome-session. When the maximum number of file descriptors is exhausted in the gnome-session process, it will enter an infinite loop trying to communicate without success, consuming 100% of the CPU. The graphical session associated with the gnome-session process will stop working correctly, because communication with gnome-session is no longer possible.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-11171", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGnome\u00bbGnome-sessionVersions  up to, including, (<=) 2.29.92cpe:2.3:a:gnome:gnome-session:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 6 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.04%  -0.84 ", "CVSS Scores": "4.9", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-835 Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/835/Loop-with-Unreachable-Exit-Condition-Infinite-Loop-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1025068", "ref_desc": "Bug 1025068 \u2013 VUL-0: CVE-2017-2626: libICE: Weak Entropy Usage in Session Keys in libICEIssue Tracking;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://github.com/GNOME/gnome-session/commit/b0dc999e0b45355314616321dbb6cb71e729fc9d", "ref_desc": "[gsm] Delay the creation of the GsmXSMPClient until it really exists \u00b7 GNOME/gnome-session@b0dc999 \u00b7 GitHubThird Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
