{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-11614", "Description": "MEDHOST Connex contains hard-coded credentials that are used for customer database access. An attacker with knowledge of the hard-coded credentials and the ability to communicate directly with the database may be able to obtain or modify sensitive patient and financial information. Connex utilizes an IBM i DB2 user account for database access. The account name is HMSCXPDN. Its password is hard-coded in multiple places in the application. Customers do not have the option to change this password. The account has elevated DB2 roles, and can access all objects or database tables on the customer DB2 database. This account can access data through ODBC, FTP, and TELNET. Customers without Connex installed are still vulnerable because the MEDHOST setup program creates this account.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-11614", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nMedhost\u00bbConnex\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:medhost:connex:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 56 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2024-12-17  0.22%  0.18%  -0.04 \n 2  2024-09-17  0.20%  0.22%  +0.02 \n 3  2024-04-25  0.19%  0.20%  +0.01 \n 4  2024-03-15  0.17%  0.19%  +0.02 \n 5  2024-02-09  0.22%  0.17%  -0.05 \n 6  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.22%  -0.66 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/798/Use-of-Hard-coded-Credentials.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Jul/59", "ref_desc": "Full Disclosure: MEDHOST Connex contains hard-coded database credentialsMailing List;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
