{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-11193", "Description": "Pulse Connect Secure 8.3R1 has CSRF in diag.cgi. In the panel, the diag.cgi file is responsible for running commands such as ping, ping6, traceroute, traceroute6, nslookup, arp, and Portprobe. These functions do not have any protections against CSRF. That can allow an attacker to run these commands against any IP if they can get an admin to visit their malicious CSRF page.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-11193", "Vulnerability Categories": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)", "Affected Products": "\nPulsesecure\u00bbPulse Connect Secure\u00bbVersion:8.3r1.0cpe:2.3:a:pulsesecure:pulse_connect_secure:8.3r1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.18% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 54 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.18%  -0.78 ", "CVSS Scores": "6.8", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/352/Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-CSRF-.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/99621", "ref_desc": "Pulse Connect Secure CVE-2017-11193 Cross-Site Request Forgery Vulnerability", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.sxcurity.pro/Multiple%20XSS%20and%20CSRF%20in%20Pulse%20Connect%20Secure%20v8.3R1.pdf", "ref_desc": "Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/uOdsiIl7JJb8ue9HXJUFZR5mxBE.html"}, {"ref_link": "https://twitter.com/sxcurity/status/884556905145937921", "ref_desc": "Corben Leo on Twitter: \"[New] Pulse Connect Secure (Enterprise-Level SSL VPN) - Multiple XSS & CSRF leading to Command Injection https://t.co/13sSu1Dl0w\"Third Party AdvisoryCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/WYbDy75_sOGjn3uB1w1gwb_zVng.html"}]}
