{"CVE Code": "CVE-2017-5652", "Description": "During a routine security analysis, it was found that one of the ports in Apache Impala (incubating) 2.7.0 to 2.8.0 sent data in plaintext even when the cluster was configured to use TLS. The port in question was used by the StatestoreSubscriber class which did not use the appropriate secure Thrift transport when TLS was turned on. It was therefore possible for an adversary, with access to the network, to eavesdrop on the packets going to and coming from that port and view the data in plaintext.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5652", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nApache\u00bbImpala\u00bbVersion:2.8.0cpe:2.3:a:apache:impala:2.8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions\nApache\u00bbImpala\u00bbVersion:2.7.0cpe:2.3:a:apache:impala:2.7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.15% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 50 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-03-07  0.89%  0.15%  -0.74 ", "CVSS Scores": "5.0", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-319 Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/319/Cleartext-Transmission-of-Sensitive-Information.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/5bab4424f23aebefc8108a0e30273c2a543a289df8113c461f930143@%3Cdev.impala.apache.org%3E", "ref_desc": "[SECURITY] CVE-2017-5652 Apache Impala (incubating) Information Disclosure - Pony MailMailing List;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/540831/100/0/threaded", "ref_desc": "SecurityFocus", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
