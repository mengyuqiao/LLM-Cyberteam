An attacker could use this flaw to circumvent authentication controls and gain access to restricted APIs. NOTE: some sources have a typo in which CVE-2017-7512 maps to an OpenVPN vulnerability. The proper CVE ID for that OpenVPN vulnerability is CVE-2017-7521. Specifically, CVE-2017-7521 is the correct CVE ID for TWO closely related findings in OpenVPN. Any source that lists BOTH CVE-2017-7512 and CVE-2017-7521 for OpenVPN should have listed ONLY CVE-2017-7521.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-7512", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nRedhat\u00bb3scale Api Management Platform\u00bbVersion:N/Acpe:2.3:a:redhat:3scale_api_management_platform:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.32% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 66 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-05-08  0.23%  0.32%  +0.09 \n 2  2023-04-22  0.22%  0.23%  +0.01 \n 3  2023-03-07  0.95%  0.22%  -0.73 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.5", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/863/Incorrect-Authorization.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1457997", "ref_desc": "1457997 \u2013 (CVE-2017-7512) CVE-2017-7512 3scale AMP: validation bypass in oauthIssue Tracking;Vendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2017-7512", "ref_desc": "CVE-2017-7512 - Red Hat Customer PortalVendor Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}, {"ref_link": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:1712", "ref_desc": "RHSA-2017:1712 - Security Advisory - Red Hat Customer PortalCVEs referencing this url", "ref_cve_link": "https://www.cvedetails.com/reference-url-info/yv_H3cJwurGgg0zmDnWUpvx8j7M.html"}]}
