{"CVE Code": "CVE-2016-10398", "Description": "Android 6.0 has an authentication bypass for attackers with root and physical access. Cryptographic authentication tokens (AuthTokens) used by the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) are protected by a weak challenge. This allows adversaries to replay previously captured responses and use the TEE without authenticating. All apps using authentication-gated cryptography are vulnerable to this attack, which was confirmed on the LG Nexus 5X.", "NVD Link": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-10398", "Vulnerability Categories": "N/A", "Affected Products": "\nGoogle\u00bbAndroid\u00bbVersion:6.0cpe:2.3:o:google:android:6.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*Matching versions", "EPSS Score": "0.04% Probability of exploitation activity in the next 30 days\n~ 10 % Percentile, the proportion of vulnerabilities that are scored at or less", "EPSS History": "\n #  Date  Old EPSS Score  New EPSS Score  Delta (New - Old) \n 1  2023-06-24  0.05%  0.04%  0.00 \n 2  2023-03-07  1.53%  0.05%  -1.48 ", "CVSS Scores": "7.2", "CWE": [{"CWE_ID": "CWE-264", "CWE_link": "/cwe-details/264/cwe.html"}], "Reference": [{"ref_link": "https://homepages.staff.os3.nl/~delaat/rp/2015-2016/p30/report.pdf", "ref_desc": "Technical Description;Third Party Advisory", "ref_cve_link": "N/A"}]}
